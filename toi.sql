Three key points', 'NEW DELHI: Minister of state in the Prime Minister\'s Office, Jitendra Singh, on Tuesday, triggered a controversy after he pitched for a debate on BJP\'s stand demanding the repeal of Article 370 which guarantees special status for J&K.  Singh, BJP MP from Udhampur in J&K, argued that the debate would help convince the \"unconvinced\" that the article had actually worked more to J&K\'s disadvantage.  The minister\'s pitch was in line with the stand that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took while campaigning in J&K.  Soon after, Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah strongly objected to the minister\'s statement and tweeted, \"So the new MOS PMO says process/discussions to revoke Art 370 have started. Wow, that was a quick beginning. Not sure who is talking.\"  He went on to add, \"Mark my words & save this tweet - long after Modi Govt is a distant memory either J&K won\'t be part of India or Art 370 will still exist.\"  PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti also commented on the issue, adding that irresponsible utterances on Article 370 should be stopped as they could have serious repercussions in J&K. READ ALSO: Minister calls for debate on Article 370, kicks off controversy Singh, however, retracted his earlier statement adding that the \'controversy is totally baseless\'.  First day; first show :-) pic.twitter.com/5HbRE91DFo   — Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) May 27, 2014  Here, it is important to understand what actually constitutes Article 370 and how it affects crucial aspects such as governance in Jammu & Kashmir. 1) What is Article 370? Article 370 of the Indian Constitution is a \'temporary provision\' which grants special autonomous status to Jammu & Kashmir. Under Part XXI of the Constitution of India, which deals with \"Temporary, Transitional and Special provisions\", the state of Jammu & Kashmir has been accorded special status under Article 370. All the provisions of the Constitution which are applicable to other states are not applicable to J&K. For example, till 1965, J&K had a Sadr-e-Riyasat for governor and prime minister in place of chief minister. 2) History of Article 370 The provision was drafted in 1947 by Sheikh Abdullah, who had by then been appointed prime minister of Jammu & Kashmir by Maharaja Hari Singh and Jawahar Lal Nehru. Sheikh Abdullah had argued that Article 370 should not be placed under temporary provisions of the Constitution. He wanted \'iron clad autonomy\' for the state, which Centre didn\'t comply with. 3) Provisions of Article 370 According to this article, except for defence, foreign affairs, finance and communications, Parliament needs the state government\'s concurrence for applying all other laws. Thus the state\'s residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to other Indians. As a result of this provision, Indian citizens from other states cannot purchase land or property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency under Article 360 in the state. It can declare emergency in the state only in case of war or external aggression. The Union government can therefore not declare emergency on grounds of internal disturbance or imminent danger unless it is made at the request or with the concurrence of the state government.

(5, 'Counting of votes in crucial Karnataka assembly bypolls on Monday', 'BENGALURU: The future of the four-month-old B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka will be clear on Monday when the counting of votes in the crucial byelections to 15 assembly constituencies is taken up. The counting of votes polled in the December 5 polls, which saw a voter turnout of 67.91 per cent, will begin at 8 am in 11 centres and all the results were most likely to be out by the afternoon, election officials said. The bypolls were held to fill the vacancies caused by the disqualification of 17 rebel Congress and JD(S) MLAs, whose revolt led to collapse of the H D Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in July and paved the way for BJP to come to power. Twelve of the 15 seats were held by the Congress and three by JD(S). The outcome of the bypoll, which recorded 67.91 per cent polling, is crucial for BJP, which needs to win at least six seats to remain in majority. Chief minister B S Yediyurappa had won the confidence motion on July 29 after the effective strength of the 225- member assembly (including the Speaker who has a casting vote) came down to 208 and the majority mark to 105, equivalent of BJP\'s current strength, following the disqualifications. The assembly will still have two vacant seats, where bypolls were not due to pending litigations in high court. As of now, the BJP has 105 MLAs (including an independent), the Congress 66 and the JD(S) 34. Besides, there is one BSP member, a nominated MLA and the Speaker. All arrangements, including security, have been made for the counting of votes. Prohibitory orders restricting assembly of people around the counting centre and activities that could disturb law and order have been clamped, police said. With exit polls by local news channels and agencies predicting BJP getting a clear majority winning 9-12 of the 15 seats, the ruling party leaders are confident the government would complete its term. On the eve of counting, Yediyurappa told reporters here that his party would win at least 13 seats. \"We will complete our term. Even people have the same expectations from us, he said. While the BJP has exuded confidence that the people would have voted in favour of the party for stability and development, the Congress and JD(S) were optimistic that the defectors, who have been disqualified and are now the ruling party candidates, would be rejected by the electorate. BJP had fielded 13 of the 16 disqualified legislators, who joined the party after the Supreme Court allowed them to contest the bypolls, as its candidates from their respective constituencies from where they had won in the 2018 assembly elections on Congress and JD(S) tickets. BJP and Congress were pitted in direct contest in most of the constituencies that went for the bypolls, in the southern parts of the state JD(S) was also in the fray, making it a triangular fight. In Hosakote, BJP rebel and independent supported by JD(S) Sharth Bachegowda is a key factor. In case the BJP fails to garner the required number of seats to retain majority, the state may witness another bout of political drama. Speculations were rife about Congress and JD(S), which had parted ways on a bitter note after the collapse of the Kumaraswamy government, coming together and form a coalition ministry again, though leaders of the two parties have sent mixed signals on such a possibility ahead of the polls. The bypoll results are also crucial for Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah who faced growing discontent against his unilateral style of functioning and selection of candidates for the polls. The poll outcome is also keenly awaited by JD(S)\' Kumaraswamy who aims to keep his flock together amid threats of further internal bickering. If the ruling BJP cruises to majority, Yediyurappa has a tough task of cabinet expansion ahead of him. He will have to strike a balance by accommodating the victorious disqualified legislators in his ministry as promised by him and also make place for old-guards, who have been upset over being \"neglected\" in the first round. Including the chief minister, currently there are 18 ministers in the cabinet, whose sanctioned strength is 34.

Addressing students at the 16th convocation ceremony at Symbiosis International University here, Naidu said there was a need to strategise to ensure Indian universities can rank among the top 100 and then in the top 50 in the world. \"We have to again make India a vishwa guru. And for that to happen, we have to improve the quality of education in Indian universities. It is sad to note no Indian university could find a place among the top 300 universities in this year\'s Time World University Ranking. We need to think about the factors responsible for this,\" he said. He said there was urgent need to fill posts of teaching staff lying vacant in Central and state universities, and claimed the Union government had taken proactive steps in this regard recently. He said, in order to create world-class universities, there was a need to attract the best talent as teachers in Indian universities. \"To make teaching more attractive, faculty should be encouraged to undertake consultancy projects and must be provided financial support for start-ups. At the same time, we have to ensure accountability and performance of teachers,\" said the vice president. He said, in many foreign universities, performance of college faculty is evaluated by their peers and students. \"We should consider setting up a similar mechanism for the performance audit of professors. This may complement the existing system, generally based on the number of research papers or publications by the teachers. After the quality of education, another issue of utmost importance is affordability of education,\" he said. Naidu said education is enlightenment, empowerment, enhancement, and lastly employment. \"But unfortunately we are taking the last one as the first one...Today values are going down in every field. Be it politics, public life, administration, journalism, judiciary, there is a certain erosion that has taken place... we must arrest it and must go back to our values,\" he said. Naidu stressed on teaching \"our history\" to children so that they draw inspiration from it. \"Unfortunately, due to colonial rule, our history is not properly written. Our history was not properly included in the syllabus because we followed Macaulay\'s education system,\" he lamented. Naidu said it was unfortunate that even after 70 plus years of Independence, remnants of colonial systems continue. \"Time has come to give up this colonial mindset, colonial education and go back to our ancient, Indian, traditional, rich, curricular heritage and history of our education,\" he said. Naidu asked students to be prepared for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, adding there was need for sustainable solutions to every day challenges. \"We need good policy support and resource-management advice from institutes such as this, for our science, technology and innovation to fructify and improve the quality of human lives,\" he added.

(7, 'Citizenship bill to be tabled in Lok Sabha for passage on Monday', 'NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday will introduce in the Lok Sabha the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that seeks to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan escaping religious persecution there. In the afternoon, the home minister will introduce the Bill to amend the six-decade-old Citizenship Act and later in the day, it will be taken up for discussion and passage, according to the Lok Sabha\'s List of Business for Monday. The Bill has triggered widespread protests in northeastern states with a large section of people and organisations opposing the Bill, saying it will nullify the provisions of the Assam Accord of 1985, which fixed March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for deportation of all illegal immigrants irrespective of religion. The influential North East Students\' Organisation (NESO) is calling an 11-hour bandh on December 10 in the region. Members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship, according to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB), 2019. To assuage feelings of tribals of the Northeast, where many feel that permanent settlement of illegal immigrants will disturb the region\'s demography, the government has made provisions under which the Bill will not be applicable in the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime areas and those tribal regions that are governed under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. \"In Citizenship Act, in Section 2 in sub-section (i), in clause (b) the following proviso shall be inserted namely:- \"provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December 2014 and who has been exempted by the central government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder shall not be treated as illegal migrants for the purposes of this Act,\" the Bill said. Such refugees will be given Indian citizenship after they have resided in India for five years (six years in CAB 2016), instead of 11 years earlier, it said. The Bill also proposes to give immunity to such refugees facing legal cases after being found illegal migrants. \"On and from the date of commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, any proceeding pending against a person under this section in respect of illegal migration or citizenship shall stand abated on conferment of citizenship to him. \"Provided that such person shall not be disqualified for making application for citizenship under this section on the ground that the proceeding pending against him and the central government or authority specified by it in this behalf shall not reject his application on that ground if he is otherwise found qualified for grant of citizenship under section,\" it said. The Bill also states: \"Provided further that the person who makes the application for citizenship under this section shall not be deprived of his rights and privileges to which he was entitled on the date of receipt of his application on the ground of making such application\". According to the proposed legislation, the amendment will not be applicable to the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and in the areas covered under The Inner Line, notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873. The ILP regime is applicable in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram. The Bill also proposes to incorporate a sub-section (d) to Section 7, providing for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force. However, the cancellation order shall not be passed unless the OCI card-holder has been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. This amendment was also proposed in the 2016. The Bill was an election promise of the BJP in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The BJP-led NDA government had introduced the Bill in its previous tenure and got the Lok Sabha\'s approval. But it did not introduce it in the Rajya Sabha, apparently due to vehement protests in the Northeast. That bill lapsed following the dissolution of the last Lok Sabha.

The authorities concerned have been asked to submit a \"detailed report\" on the fire incident which is dubbed as the second biggest tragedy in the national capital after Uphaar Cinema fire in 1997, that killed 59 people and injured over 100 more. Sources said that the home ministry asked the Delhi police to submit details of the incident and the action taken thereafter, as well as the flouting of norms. The move comes after Union home minister Amit Shah in a tweet called the incident a tragic loss of precious lives and instructed concerned authorities to provide all help. \"Tragic loss of precious lives in the fire accident in New Delhi. My deepest condolences with the families of those who have lost their loved ones. I pray for the early recovery of the injured. Have instructed concerned authorities to provide all possible assistance on an urgent basis,\" Shah had tweeted after the fire incident. At least 43 people, most of them reportedly children in the age group of 14 to 20, were killed and over a dozen others injured in the fire that broke out in the bag manufacturing unit around 5am due to short circuit. The people who died in the fire are labourers from Bihar and other neighbouring states and they were sleeping in the factory when the fire broke out. So far, more than 63 people have been rescued and shifted to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital and Lady Harding hospital.

Twenty two years later, on Sunday morning, December 8, 2019, another fire broke out in a factory in a crowded market in Delhi\'s Rani Jhansi Road area killing 43 so far, making it Delhi\'s second worst fire incident since Uphaar tragedy. While 59 people died being trapped inside, mostly due to suffocation at Uphaar, and as many as 103 were injured, in Delhi\'s, Anaj Mandi fire tragedy, at least 43 are killed and dozens injured. There was an oil leakage at the Uphaar site and the fire spread over to the parking bay gutting 27 cars that were parked there. Thankfully, on Sunday, the fire wasn\'t allowed to spread to the surrounding areas. While, the national capital\'s worst fire incident broke out in the afternoon during the screening of the movie Border, between 3-6pm; very few know the trigger started in the morning on that fateful day at 6.55am, when a transformer on the ground floor of the Uphaar Cinema caught fire. On Sunday, the fire broke out early in the morning, between 4.30am and 5am, at Delhi\'s Anaj Mandi area. Calling it the biggest ever fire tragedy in the history of Delhi after Uphaar Cinema fire, a Delhi fire service (DFS) officer, requesting anonymity told IANS, the factory had \"flouted\" the fire safety norms and there was \"no proper exit\". In the case of Uphaar fire incident that dragged into a long legal tangle, in 2015, a trial court had convicted the Ansal brothers, who owned the theatre. However it had spared them a jail term due to their age. Later when the matter went to the Supreme Court, it had sent Gopal Ansal to jail for one year, sparing Sushil Ansal. It was meant to be just another relaxed Sunday for the labourers at Anaj Mandi, who were there in the factory. But they were trapped. Dozens of them, couldn\'t see the day break. Initial reports suggest the building had no proper fire exit, leading those inside to suffocate to death. For those who were around in Delhi during 1997, it brought back a dash of old memories - of fire, people being trapped and dying.

Speaking to a news channel, Fadnavis said Ajit Pawar had assured him of support of all 54 NCP MLAs. \"He made me talk to some MLAs who told me they wanted to go with the BJP.

He said: \"As we speak now, freedom is denied to 75 lakh people in the Kashmir valley,\" adding, if freedom of one person was denied, it meant denying it for all the people. \"Freedom cannot be separated, yours is mine and mine is yours and if I do not protect your freedom, you cannot protect mine,\" he said on his arrival here from Delhi. After being in Tihar Jail and in the custody of CBI and the Enforcement Directorate for 106 days, he was released on December 4 following grant of bail by the Supreme Court in a money laundering case filed by the ED. After he was given a rousing welcome by Congress workers, Chidambaram told reporters: \"In this country, a right wing, retrograde (government) is moving towards a fascist type of government that usurped freedom...we have to be very vigilant.\" The country will become truly independent only when the people in the rest of the nation showed south India\'s vigil and in particular Tamil Nadu\'s caution in opposing the BJP, he claimed. On his case, he said he will not talk about it, adding,\" Why I was imprisoned? They (the Centre) thought of wrecking my mental strength and it will not happen any day. If anybody had thought that I will fall, I will never fall as the Congress party and the Indian people\'s thirst for freedom are behind me...it is going to be a fight continuously,\" he said. Chidambaram also accused the government of trying to wreck his physical health, adding they succeeded for about 10 days. After the court\'s intervention and examination by doctors, \"today (my) health has more or less improved fully,\" he said. Asked about Union minister Prakash Javadekar\'s charge that he has violated his bail conditions, he said: \"Prakash Javadekar does not know about the (Supreme Court) court\'s verdict and he also does not about what I had spoken.\" Later, addressing a public meeting at the Congress party\'s State headquarters here he said: \"This morning, the price of onion in Delhi was Rs 200 a kilo, while a farmer in Maharashtra producing it gets Rs seven a kg for it. We should talk only about that.\" He alleged that BJP\'s objective was to \"strangulate the voice of freedom\" and the ruling party had been working towards it by targeting rivals by filing cases against them. \"Newspapers should not write, television channels should not debate,\" he said adding the ruling party\'s goal was also to not allow \"political leaders\" (rivals) to criticise it. To ensure implementation of its agenda, the ruling party at the Centre was bent on \"strangulating\" their voices, he alleged. Citing the recent income tax raids against former Karnataka deputy chief minister G Parameshwara and another leader, he said Congress MP KC Ramamurthy subsequently joined the BJP. Similarly, TDP\'s CM Ramesh and YS Chowdary, who were the \"left and right hands\" of party chief Chandrababu Naidu had earlier this year joined the saffron party. \"Both of them have cases against them and both are today in the BJP,\" he said. Sarcastically, Chidambaram likened the BJP to river Ganga, a dip in which is believed to cleanse devotees of their sins. \"The BJP is River Ganga and all sins will vanish after taking a bath in it. I will never take a bath in that Ganga (the BJP). I will bow before justice and judge, I will never bend before injustice,\" he said, apparently indicating that he will not buckle under pressure and join the BJP. Making light of his incarceration, he said \"spending 106 days in jail\" was nothing big when compared to the incarceration of leaders of the freedom movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru. \"I happily accept my imprisonment,\" he said. Quoting a popular verse of nationalist poet Subramania Bharathi, he said the bard may have sung it \"bearing Modi in mind.\" The part of the verse, which Chidambaram emphasised can roughly be translated as, \"I will not go down (fall) like some amusing people...\", which is seen as directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party. \"Till such time you (people) are there, the Congress party, which won us freedom, is there. Till the memory of freedom fighters like Gandhiji, Nehru, Tilak, Sardar Patel, Kamaraj, VO Chidambaram Pillai lingers...you thought that I will fall ? No, never,\" he said.

(43, '\'Second war of independence\': TMC eyes citizenship bill to take on BJP ahead of state polls', 'KOLKATA: Buoyed by the success in the recent bypolls, which the ruling Trinamool Congress fought campaigning against the NRC, Mamata Banerjee\'s party has now eyed the Citizenship Ammendment Bill to reach out to voters ahead of the 2021 assembly polls, to corner the BJP. Termed by Banerjee as the \"second war of independence\", campaign against the contentious bill will be at the centre of the party\'s poll pitch, said senior TMC leaders, who feel that 120 seats that have significant minority and refugee population will be a deciding factor in the next elections. Members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan facing persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship when the proposed amendments to the six-decade-old Citizenship Act come into effect with passage of the bill. Addressing a rally in Kolkata on Friday, Banerjee said she would support the bill if citizenship is given to each and every refugee, irrespective of their religion. \"We could not take part in the first freedom struggle which gave us our independence. But we will take part in the second freedom movement. We will resist NRC and CAB,\" said Banerjee, who has time and again taken shots at the BJP over the issue. TMC leaders, who spoke to PTI on condition of anonymity, said the party\'s top brass is of the opinion that after National Register of Citizens (NRC), the bill would act as \"nail in the coffin of the BJP in Bengal\". \"We all have witnessed how the tide has changed against the BJP in Bengal in just six months after Lok Sabha polls. It was the NRC in Assam that went against them. Now, this CAB would cause more damage to the BJP. They have failed to gauge people\'s mood on these two issues,\" a senior TMC leader said. \"We too have regularised refugee colonies, but we didn\'t see religion in it. They (BJP government) can set a criteria for granting citizenship but religion can never be that criteria,\" the TMC leader said. He exuded confidence that campaigning against the bill would reap benefits for the party in run up to the elections in the state where civic body polls are scheduled next year. \"Just like NRC, CAB too would be a blunder, if not on a bigger scale. It will act as a political trump card for us in Bengal against the BJP,\" he added. Bengal being a bordering state, has housed a large number of refugees who came during Partition and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Left parties have always bagged most of the seats having large number of refugee population, but after 2011, with regime change in the state, they switched loyalties to the TMC. However, in the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year, BJP won a large number of seats in these refugee belts of the state. But after the NRC was published in Assam, in which a large numbers of Hindus were left out, the scales seem to have tilted in favour of the TMC in West Bengal as it wrestled Kaliaganj and Karimpur assembly seats, where it was a major issue, in bypolls. According to sources in the TMC\'s parliamentary unit, it along with other opposition parties have decided on an eight-point agenda to counter the BJP on the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which is likely to be tabled in Parliament next week. \"If the government is talking about one nation, one election, one law, then how come they are setting different criteria for Northeastern states by using the Sixth Schedule and Inner Line Permit. This itself is a double standard,\" a senior TMC MP said. The opposition to this bill, which is not only divisive and against the principles of the Constitution, will take place both inside and outside Parliament, he said. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, the new law, however, will not be applicable in the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime areas and those tribal regions which are governed under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The TMC has issued a whip to all its members for being present in Parliament on all four days from Monday, in anticipation of the Citizenship Amendment Bill being introduced by the Centre. The BJP\'s West Bengal unit, however, thinks that the bill would do wonders for the party in the state as it will further lead to consolidation of Hindu votes in the bordering districts. \"If TMC opposes the bill then it means they are anti-Hindus. The bill is being brought to give citizenship to all Hindu refugees and non-Muslims. The TMC is just worried that it might lose its minority vote bank,\" state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and to challenge the death sentence. In its verdict in the case on July 17, the ICJ ordered Pakistan to undertake an \"effective\" review of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and asked it to grant consular access to him without further delay.

She said she would support the Bill, expected to be tabled in Lok Sabha next week, if citizenship is given to each and every refugee, irrespective of their religion. Claiming that at least 30 people have committed suicide in the state due to panic over the National Register of Citizens (NRC) being implemented here, Mamata Banerjee said, in a secular country like India, citizenship can never be accorded on the basis of religion. Criticising the Centre for failing to control price rise and tackle slowdown, the chief minister said the BJP government has failed to revive the economic situation and is busy conducting mock fights of \"Hindustan and Pakistan\". Members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan facing persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship when the proposed amendments to the six-decade-old Citizenship Act come into effect. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, the new law, however, will not be applicable in the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime areas and those tribal regions which are governed under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Both the NRC and the CAB are being used to divert attention of people from the ongoing economic slowdown in the country, Banerjee, also the TMC supremo, said while addressing a party rally here. \"The NRC and the CAB are both two sides of the same coin. Will oppose them tooth and nail,\" she said. The CAB was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier this year but lapsed. \"You (BJP) can pass CAB in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha as you have majority, but we will not accept it and oppose it till the end. I would ask all political parties to oppose it. There can\'t be differentiation on the basis of religion. India is a secular country,\" she said. Hitting out at the \"inflitrator\" jibe of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Banerjee wondered whether all the governments elected so far are \"illegal\". \"You are calling Muslims infiltrators, if it is so, then since Independence so many governments have been formed both at states and Centre, with votes of all the communities, will you now declare those governments as illegal too?\" she asked. \"In 2014 and 2019, the BJP won the elections and they also got votes of all the communities. So is the BJP government also illegal as they have also got votes of so-called infiltrators,\" she said. Banerjee also attacked the Centre over steep price rise of onions. \"Prices of onions are skyrocketing but they are busy in Hindustan-Pakistan fights. Will that yield onions for people? It is astounding that the finance minister stands up in the House and says she does not eat onions. Whose subject is price rise? It\'s the Centre\'s responsibility,\" Banerjee said while addressing the annual \'Sanhati Dibas\' rally at Mayo Road in the heart of the city. \"The economy of the country is in a slump. The country will go bankrupt in the future. People will go bankrupt,\" she said. \"People\'s money is no longer safe. If you keep your savings at home, they will usurp it in the name of demonetisation. If you keep your money in the bank, there is no guarantee for its safety,\" Banerjee said.

(65, 'Encounter killings draw mixed political reactions', 'NEW DELHI: The \'encounter\' killing of the four men accused in the rape and murder of a woman veterinarian in Hyderabad evoked mixed political reactions on Friday, ranging from fulsome praise to outright condemnation, with some preferring to exercise circumspection in their response. With many political parties being of the view that the encounter killing may have drawn some public support, even the strong rivals of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi such as the BJP and the Congress refrained from criticising the police action, which has drawn condemnation from civil right groups, and left it to individual voices within their organisations to offer a mixture of views. The Left parties, however, took a strong stand with CPM\'s Sitaram Yechury asserting that alleged extra-judicial killings cannot be the answer to the serious concerns over the safety of women. The CPI\'s D Raja said no one can justify encounters in the name of speedy justice. \"How we must secure the lives and dignity of each of our citizens, must be what civilised societies are about. Justice can never be retribution. Why is the tough law put in place on the safety of women after the 2012 Delhi crime not being implemented properly?\" CPM general secretary Yechury said. BJP leaders such as Meenakshi Lekhi and Rajyavardhan Rathore hailed the police action while another party leader Maneka Gandhi slammed the encounter, saying it has set a \"horrifying\" precedent. Senior Congress leaders like P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor reacted cautiously with the former finance minister saying that the incident should be thoroughly enquired into to find out if it was a genuine encounter. Another Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury noted that a magisterial inquiry is already on and his party will wait for its outcome. Chidambaram told reporters, \"I don\'t know the facts of what happened in Hyderabad. As a responsible person all I can say is, it must be thoroughly inquired into to find out if it was a genuine encounter, whether they were trying to flee or it was anything else.\" Tharoor said people should not rush to condemn the encounter until details emerge.

He highlighted the fact that the \'sangathan\' has been awarded with Gandhi Peace Prize due to its commitment towards social service and for being a role model for the whole country. Modi suggested that to celebrate the 75 years of Independence in 2022, the \'sangathan\' should encourage its school children to organise skits, musical competitions, debates and discussions to highlight the role of tribes in the Indian freedom movement.

A 5-judge bench, headed by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, had in a unanimous verdict on November 9 decreed the entire 2.77-acre disputed land in favour of deity \'Ram Lalla\' and also directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot to Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque in Ayodhya. Four separate fresh review petitions have been filed by Maulana Mufti Hasbullah, Mohd Umar, Maulana Mahfoozur Rehman and Mishbahuddin, who are supported by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). In a press release, the four review petitioners through their counsel M R Shamshad, said that AIMPLB had decided on November 17 that it would support filing of review pleas in the matter. On December 2, the first review petition in the case was filed by Maulana Syed Ashhad Rashidi, legal heir of original litigant M Siddiq and Uttar Pradesh president of Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind saying that \"complete justice\" could only be done by directing reconstruction of Babri Masjid. While key litigant, Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board, decided against challenging the verdict, Maulana Syed Ashhad Rashidi has sought review of the verdict on 14 counts. In his review plea, Maulana Mufti Hasbullah has said that the top court should reconsider the \"grave injustice\" to a community in a title suit. \"Title could not have been given to Hindu parties on the basis of exclusive possession of entire site which never existed at any point in time with the Hindus since it is admitted that Muslims entered and prayed at the site till December 1949, and later prevented from doing so because of the attachment while unfairly permitting Hindu worship following criminal trespass,\" Hasbullah said in his plea, which has been settled by senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan and Zafaryab Jilani. The plea said that the November 9 verdict \"condones serious illegalities of destruction, criminal trespass and violation of rule of law including damaging the Mosque and eventually destroying it\". \"The judgment erred in accepting the juristic personality of the idol entitled it to the 3 domed structure and the courtyard while holding that the idol was illegally and forcibly put there. An idol as deity cannot be simultaneously illegally placed and legally valid to claim the title,\" Hasbullah said in his plea. It said since it is undisputed that Muslims were praying on the site till December 16, 1949 and entered the Mosque through the outer courtyard, this fact proves that the Hindus were never in exclusive possession. \"The court erred in not considering that there was a dedication of the mosque which was self-evident from the inscriptions,\" it said, adding, \"the judgment erred in holding that the waqf was not established by \'user\' though continuous possession and prayer were shown at all times.\" \"It also wrongly assumed that prayers did not take place at mosque before 1857 but used 1857 onwards alone as relevant,\" one of the review petitions said. It further said, \"the judgment under review erred in allotting alternate land of 5 acres to the Sunni Waqf Board under Article 142 even though the same was not pleaded for.\" In the first review plea, Rashidi has sought an interim stay on operation of the verdict in which it had directed the Centre that a trust be formed within three months for construction of the temple at the site. Rashidi has also questioned the direction asking the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government to allot 5 acre land for construction of a mosque at a prominent place in Ayodhya, saying that such a prayer was never made by the Muslim parties. It was also submitted that despite acknowledging several illegalities committed by the Hindu parties, including the destruction of the mosque at the disputed site, the apex court condoned them and granted the land to them.

The minister said before taking any decision on the issue of formulation of menopause policy for women employees in government and private sectors, consultations with stakeholders and experts and careful consideration of all aspects of the matter is required. Irani said firm research findings relating to the subject area of physical and mental stress faced by such women employees as a result of menopause, may also be required. \"Currently there is no menopause policy for women employees in government and private sectors,\" she said during Question Hour. The minister said menopause is a normal consequence of the ageing process and is a natural female hormone deficient state that occurs at the age of 45-55 years. In this stage, ovaries gradually become less active and reduce their production of sex hormone (estrogen and progesterone). As a result, menses cease permanently. Women are usually considered to be menopausal if they have not had a menstrual period for one year without any underlying cause, she said. Irani said some women experience mild problems or none at all but some women have severe symptoms in this period. It is an inevitable phenomenon in women\'s lives who further spend many years of life in the postmenopausal phase. The minister said the National Health Mission envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable and quality health care services that are responsive to peoples needs. The strategy is based on provision of comprehensive care through the five pillars or thematic areas of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health and is guided by central tenets of equity, universal care, entitlement, and accountability, and it has been developed to provide an understanding of \'continuum of care\' to ensure equal focus on various life stages.

Rahul Gandhi did not spare home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman either and took potshots at them during the hectic tour of his Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency. He lashed out at Sitharaman, saying she was \"incompetent\", not aware of what was happening around her and had the \"arrogance\" to say she does not eat onions or garlic. The Congress leader, who is on a three-day visit to Wayanad, said his party will oppose the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill aimed at providing citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. His statement comes as the bill, which has created strong resentment in the northeastern states, is set to be tabled in Parliament. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah were \"living in their own imagination\" and have no contacts with the outside world, Rahul said in Kozhikode as he embarked on his tour of Wayanad, addressing a series of his party-led United Democratic Front (UDF) meetings and opened a science block of a local school here. Replying to a query on the government\'s claim that there was no financial crisis in the country, Rahul Gandhi said: \"Mr Amit Shah and Mr Narendra Modi live in their own imagination.They have no contact with the outside world. They live in their own world and they fantasise about things.

Union minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters that the claim of Chidambaram, who was released on bail on Wednesday, amounted to \"self-certification\". The Supreme Court had asked the Congress leader not to speak about the case against him while ordering his release on bail. \"P Chidambaram has violated the bail condition on the very first day after his release.... What he said is in violation of this condition,\" the BJP leader said. A Supreme Court bench, while granting bail to Chidambaram, asked him not to make any public comment in connection with the case. Addressing a press conference at the Congress headquarters, the former finance minister had said earlier, \"In the last 106 days, I was strong in spirit and I have become stronger because...my record as minister and my conscience are absolutely clear.\" Taking a jibe at the opposition leader over his attack on the Modi government on a host of issues, Javadekar said he has got to speak to the media after so many days and that is why he was taking out his anger on every subject. Some Congress leaders are in jail, some have just got out of jail and some are on bail, he said, adding that the opposition party has become desperate. It is not that they were in jail for their role in \"freedom movement\" but due to criminal charges against them, he said. Hitting back at Chidambaram over his criticism of the government that it had denied basic freedom to people in Kashmir since Article 370 was nullified in August, the Union minister said all media outlets have been functioning in the Valley. \"Kashmir is now on path to progress,\" Javadekar said. At the beginning of his press conference, Chidambaram had said his first thoughts upon his release were with the Kashmiri people who \"have been denied their basic freedoms since August 4, 2019.\" Invoking the Emergency imposed by the Congress government in 1975, Javadekar said the then Indira Gandhi government had clamped down on the media while the Modi government has shared all information related to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with Parliament. The government has allowed journalists from India and abroad to travel to Kashmir where, he added, incidents of stone-pelting have come down by more than half.

Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the party\'s outspoken national vice-president, launched a veiled attack on the newly appointed state president Jagadanand Singh, alleging that the party office here almost resembled a \"government office\". Both leaders have been associated with the RJD since its inception in 1997. \"Discipline ought to be self-enforced and not imposed from outside. It needs to be appreciated that our party workers are not our paid employees. \"We must try not to make the party office resemble a government office,\" the RJD vice-president told reporters here in an apparent reference to a recent restriction barring entry of visitors to the party state chief\'s chamber without permit. He, however, did not elaborate further, but RJD sources said he had been unhappy with the style of functioning of Jagadanand Singh - a man of few words, known to be a stickler for propriety. The sources also said on condition of anonymity that Jagadanand Singh\'s appointment, last month, as the state unit president has hogged limelight by virtue of his being the first upper caste leader to hold the post. This has not gone well with former minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh - who is also a Rajput like Jagadanand Singh and considered by many as the party\'s most well-known face from the influential community. When asked about the former Union minister\'s outbursts, the state RJD chief deftly replied, \"I am just heading the state unit. He, as national vice-president, holds an office higher than mine. I will consult him and try to remove shortcomings in my working that I may not be aware of.\" Jagadanand, however, added, \"The re-election of Lalu Prasad as the national president took place at the party office yesterday. My impression is that it went off fine. Nobody was unhappy with the state of affairs. Moreover, our party workers are a bold and assertive lot, they are unlikely to feel slighted over any trifle.\" Notably, the state unit chief and the national vice- president were present at the RJD state headquarters here on Tuesday when nomination papers were filed on behalf of the jailed party supremo by his sons Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, both of whom made a rare joint appearance putting aside their tug of war. There are also speculations that Raghuvansh Prasad Singh may have felt rebuffed as, barely a day after his having made a fresh pitch for the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar\'s return to the anti-NDA front, Jagadanand Singh had asserted \"there is going to be no compromise on Tejashwi\'s leadership\". Meanwhile, the chief minister\'s Janata Dal (United) took a swipe at the RJD and expressed sympathy with Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, claiming that he \"does not shy away from speaking his mind\". \"It has become evident that in the RJD, there is no space for you unless you are in the good books of Lalu\'s TTM - Tejashwi, Tej Pratap and Misa (eldest daughter),\" JD(U) spokesman Nikhil Mandal said. Interestingly, \"TTM\" has been a popular term in the political lexicon of Bihar, coined by Lalu Prasad, who had come up with it as an abbreviation of \"tabadtod tel malish\" - a slangy metaphor for sycophancy. \"Raghuvansh babu is one person in the RJD, who has always been known to speak his mind.

Polling will be held between 7 am to 6 pm on Thursday in the 15 constituencies where a total of 37.78 lakh electors are eligible to cast their votes and all arrangements have been made for the exercise, officials said. The byelections are being held to fill the vacancies caused by the disqualification of 17 rebel Congress and JDS MLAs, whose rebellion led to the collapse of the H D Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in July and paved the way for the BJP to come to power. The BJP needs to win at least six of the seats to remain in majority in the 225-member assembly (including the Speaker, who has a casting vote), which would still have two vacant seats - Maski and R R Nagar. In the assembly with the current strength of 208 after the disqualifications, the BJP has 105 MLAs (including an independent), the Congress 66 and the JD(S) has 34 MLAs. There is also one BSP member, a nominated member and the Speaker. Thirteen of the disqualified MLAs have been fielded by the BJP after they joined the party last month following the Supreme Court allowing them to contest the bypolls. During the campaign, the BJP sought votes for \"stability\", while the Congress and JD(S) urged the electorate to defeat the disqualified legislators responsible for the collapse of their coalition government in July. Among 15 constituencies going to the bypolls, 12 were held by Congress and three by JD(S). BJP has fielded 13 of the 16 disqualified legislators as its candidates from their respective constituencies from where they had won in the 2018 assembly elections on Congress and JDS tickets. A total number of 165 candidates - 156 men and 9 women - are in the fray. Among the major political parties, while BJP and Congress are contesting all the 15 seats while the JD(S) has fielded candidates in 12. The constituencies going to bypolls are: Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Yellapur, Hirekerur, Ranibennur, Vijayanagar, Chikballapur, KR Puram, Yeshwanthpur, Mahalakshmi Layout, Shivajinagar, Hoskote, KR Pet and Hunsur. Speculations are rife about Congress and JD(S) not being averse to joining hands once again to form a coalition government in case the BJP fails to garner the required number of seats to stay in majority. Political parties and officials were of the view that there is a general feeling among public at large against the bypolls and political developments that led to it and this might affect the turnout. In any by-election voter turnout will be low, it is not surprising but it cannot be said it will affect or benefit any particular party, because, if the turnout is low, across the constituencies it will be low, a senior BJP functionary said. A senior Congress office-bearer too said the voter turnout was expected to be low according to the party\'s internal analysis. However, he said, despite low voter turnout, it would be advantage Congress as most of those who will come to vote this time will be those who want to defeat the disqualified. \"The voice and sentiments are against the disqualified, so it will benefit us,\" he claimed. He also said there were chances of core BJP supporters \'displeased\' with tickets being given to outsiders (the disqualified MLAs) staying away from mobilising voters and this would also help the Congress. Chief minister B S Yediyurappa has urged the voters to come out and vote in large numbers as it was their right. Only if there is 80-85 per cent voter turnout it will give a meaning to democratic system. As there is holiday in 15 constituencies going for polls, I request the electorate to come out and vote, he said. The Election Commission and police have made elaborate arrangements for the smooth conduct of the bypolls in all the 15 constituencies. According to election officials, a total of 37,77,970 electors, including 18,42,027 women, are eligible to cast their votes at 4,185 polling stations in the bypolls. There are also 4,711 service voters. Out of total 42,509 personnel deployed for election management, 19,299 are polling personnel. As many as 11,241 personnel from state police and 2,511 Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) would be on security duty. Polling officials said 884 polling stations have been marked critical and 414 stations will be manned by CAPF.

Minister Jayant Patil said the Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP government favoured granting relief to those who were falsely implicated. NCP MLA Dhananjay Munde wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, demanding withdrawal of cases related to the Koregaon-Bhima violence, claiming the previous BJP-led government had slapped \"false\" cases against many including social activists and branded them as \"urban naxals\". On Wednesday, Congress leader Naseem Khan too demanded withdrawal of cases filed against Dalit activists who had protested against the Koregaon Bhima violence, and a similar relief for participants of Maratha quota agitation. Both these agitations were for seeking \"natural justice\", Khan said in a letter to Thackeray. The demand for relief for those facing cases in connection with Koregaon Bhima riots elicited a sharp response from the BJP. \"The NCP\'s demand for withdrawal of cases is a blatant support to naxalism. Even the court has admitted that there is preliminary evidence against the accused, which is the reason the court did not accept their bail applications,\" state BJP chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said. \"Chargesheets have been filed in the case. How can one simply withdraw the cases?\" Bhandari asked. On Wednesday, Jayant Patil, NCP leader and state minister, said the government favoured granting relief to those who were falsely implicated in cases related to the Koregaon-Bhima violence. \"We have received memorandums from several people claiming they were falsely framed ... Such steps (withdrawal) were taken in the past too,\" Patil told reporters here. \"The government wants to see nobody faces injustice ... the government\'s view is to give relief to those who were falsely framed,\" he added. The government will not support anyone who played intentional role in the violence, he said, adding that final decision rests with CM Thackeray, because the home portfolio (as other ministries) has not been allotted yet. Violence erupted near Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in Pune district on January 1, 2018, a day after the Elgar Parishad conclave organised to commemorate 200 years of a famous battle between the Peshwa and the East India Company\'s army which had Dalit soldiers. A subsequent bandh called by Dalit outfits to protest the violence and police\'s alleged high-handedness saw incidents of vandalism. Dalits commemorate victory of the East India Company in the 1818 battle, looking upon it as a triumph over the upper caste establishment represented by the Peshwa. Thackeray said on Tuesday that the earlier BJP-led government had already ordered withdrawal of cases involving minor criminal charges related to the Koregaon Bhima riot. Some of the activists arrested by the Pune police in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima case were later accused of having links with naxals, and booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

He said the armies patrol areas according to their understanding of the LAC and \"sometimes our forces also go (in the area claimed by China)\". The minister, who faced interruptions from Congress members, said the two armies have mechanisms in place to prevent escalation in such situations and these include flag meetings and hotline. Singh said the government was fully alert to the security needs of the country, conducts reviews from time to time and takes requisite steps. \"There is no need to feel concerned about the country\'s security.

The top court\'s observation came in its verdict granting bail to senior Congress leader P Chidambaram in the INX Media money laundering case in which the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had submitted the alleged incriminating documents in a sealed cover for perusal of the judges. A bench headed by Justice R Banumathi said it was not justified for the Delhi high court to record the findings in its November 15 verdict denying bail to Chidambaram based on the material submitted in sealed cover by the ED. \"Hence in our opinion, the finding recorded by the Judge of the High Court based on the material in sealed cover is not justified,\" it said. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, set aside the high court order and granted bail to the 74-year-old former finance minister, who has been in custody for 105 days. \"...though it is held that it would be open for the Court to peruse the documents, it would be against the concept of fair trial if in every case the prosecution presents documents in sealed cover and the findings on the same are recorded as if the offence is committed and the same is treated as having a bearing for denial or grant of bail,\" the bench said. The top court said though it was not very much inclined to open the sealed cover documents submitted by the ED while opposing the bail in the case, the high court in its verdict had recorded its findings based on such material and thus it had become imperative for the court to peruse it. \"We were not very much inclined to open the sealed cover although the materials in sealed cover was received from the respondent. However, since the Single Judge of the High Court had perused the documents in sealed cover and arrived at certain conclusion and since that order is under challenge, it had become imperative for us to also open the sealed cover and peruse the contents so as to satisfy ourselves to that extent,\" the bench said. During the hearing of bail plea, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and A M Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, had vehemently opposed placing on record the documents in sealed cover by the solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the ED. It said that in the present case the High Court while adverting to the materials in the November 15 verdict, ought not have recorded a finding based on the materials produced before him. \"While the judge was empowered to look at the materials produced in a sealed cover to satisfy his judicial conscience, the Judge ought not to have recorded finding based on the materials produced in a sealed cover,\" it said. Dealing with the sealed cover document and the question to whether the court could look into the documents, the top court referred to the verdict of September 5, in which it had rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Chidambaram in the INX media money laundering case. \"...this Court had held that it would be open for the Court to receive the materials/documents collected during the investigation and peruse the same to satisfy its conscience that the investigation is proceeding in the right lines and for the purpose of consideration of grant of bail/anticipatory bail etc,\" the bench said, adding that it was also disapproved the manner in which the High Court had \"verbatim quoted\" a note produced by the ED. The top court said that on perusal of the documents submitted by the ED in sealed cover it has taken note that the statements of persons concerned in the case have been recorded and the details collected have been collated. \"The recording of statements and the collation of material is in the nature of allegation against one of the co-accused Karti Chidambaram -- son of appellant (P Chidambaram) -- of opening shell companies and also purchasing benami properties in the name of relatives at various places in different countries,\" it said, while refraining from disclosing more about the documents submitted in sealed cover.

India also gifted a fast interceptor vessel \'Kaamiyab\' to the island nation. \"This advanced vessel has been constructed by L&T in my home state, Gujarat.

Fadnavis had sought an exemption from appearance before the court in the case. Following arguments from both the sides, Judicial Magistrate First Class S D Mehta fixed January 4 as the next date of hearing. Earlier, Fadnavis\' counsel Uday Dable prayed the magistrate\'s court to allow exemption to the BJP leader from appearance in the case. He said Fadnavis could not be present in the court due to some \"unavoidable work\". The counsel said Fadnavis\' intention was not to delay the trial and proceedings. \"He is not available today due to some unavoidable work. His identity is not disputed and he is properly represented by his counsel, and his absence would not hamper the proceedings of the court,\" Dable said. However, city-based lawyer Satish Uke, who earlier filed an application in the court seeking that criminal proceedings be initiated against Fadnavis, asked the court to issue a non-bailable warrant against the accused. The petitioner said Fadnavis did not appear before the court as he had \"pre-decided\" to seek an exemption for appearance on Wednesday. Uke cited a report published in a national daily on November 4 in which Fadnavis\' counsel stated that the BJP leader need not personally remain present on the date and can seek an extension.

Three soldiers were killed when their post in Tangdhar was hit by an avalanche, while another died after his patrol was caught in a blizzard in Gurez. \"The rescue teams managed to locate and retrieve all the trapped personnel in the two incidents. But despite best efforts by medical teams, the four soldiers succumbed to their injuries,\" said an officer.  The incidents come soon after two soldiers died in an avalanche in the southern part of the forbidding Siachen Glacier on November 30, while another four soldiers and two civilian porters were similarly killed in the northern glacier on November 18. Over 1,000 Indian soldiers, including over 35 officers, have lost their lives in the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region since April 1984, when India\'s Operation Meghdhoot pre-empted Pakistan\'s Operation Ababeel to occupy almost all the dominating heights from 16,000 to 22,000-feet by a whisker, as was earlier reported by TOI. Around three-fourths of the casualties are caused by the severe terrain and climatic conditions, with temperatures sometimes even dipping to minus 60 degree Celsius, rather than enemy fire. In February 2016, for instance, 10 ill-fated soldiers from the 19 Madras Regiment - including Lance Naik Hanumanthappa Koppad who miraculously survived for over eight days - had perished after being buried under a massive ice-wall avalanche in the northern Siachen Glacier. Army officers say soldiers deployed in high-altitude regions are given prior training in mountain craft, ice craft, and survival in glaciated terrain to cope with any eventuality like avalanches, but sometimes it becomes impossible to fight nature. The soldiers are also instructed to strictly adhere to the laid-down drills and guidelines when traversing avalanche-prone slopes and negotiating crevasses on the glacial heights. Apart from avalanches, \"white-outs\" and blizzards in high-altitude regions, soldiers also have to contend with high-altitude pulmonary odema, cerebral odema, hypothermia, hypoxia and frostbite.

After the rally, the Hyderabad MP\'s brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi, and other senior leaders of the AIMIM would tour different districts of the state to strengthen the party\'s organisation, he said. The announcement of the rally at Brigade Parade Grounds, which has been witness to several historic political gatherings, comes days after a war of words between Mamata Banerjee and Owaisi, after the chief minister warned the people against \"minority extremism\", in an obvious attack on the AIMIM. Owaisi was quick to hit back, saying Muslims in the state are ranked \"worst\" on development indicators. Owaisi recently said his party has been working in the state for a year-and-a-half and will contest the next assembly elections. The AIMIM has been holding small meetings in minority-dominated areas of the city and across the state for the past few months. The political landscape of the state may go for a change with the AIMIM deciding to contest the assembly polls, signalling the advent of a new player in a hugely polarised arena where Banerjee\'s TMC holds sway over Muslim votes.

(190, 'Truth finally prevails, Congress says after SC bail to Chidambaram', 'NEW DELHI: The truth has finally prevailed, the Congress said on Wednesday after the Supreme Court granted bail to senior party leader P Chidambaram in the INX-Media money laundering case. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said Chidambaram\'s over 100 days of incarceration was \"vengeful and vindictive\", while expressing confidence that he will be able to prove his innocence in a fair trial. Chidambaram\'s son Karti heaved a sigh of relief, tweeting, \"Phew. At last after 106 days.\" Later, talking to reporters, he said, \"I am very happy that my father is coming home. It has been a long wait, it has been an unwanted incarceration.\" Several party leaders welcomed the order granting bail to the former Union minister, with Chidambaram\'s lawyer and Congress colleague Abhishek Manu Singhvi describing the ruling as \"excellent light after a rather long tunnel\". \"Truth finally prevails #SatyamevaJayate,\" tweeted the party from its official handle. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was more circumspect and said \"justice delayed is justice denied\", adding the bail should have been granted much earlier. A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R Banumathi, granted bail to the 74-year-old former Union finance minister, who has been in custody since August 21 when he was arrested by the CBI in the INX-Media corruption case. The Enforcement Directorate had arrested him on October 16 in the money laundering case. Singhvi termed the order \"balanced\", \"nuanced\" and \"comprehensive\" and a great order in favour of human rights and balanced jurisprudence. The BJP took a dig at the Congress\'s reaction following the Supreme Court bail, saying that Chidambaram has joined the \"Out On Bail Club\". Asked about the BJP\'s allegations against his father, Karti told a TV channel, \"If they have evidence, they must take it to the court and put it before us and not hide behind this sealed cover tactic... Nobody is saying we won\'t face trial. I\'m happy to face trial.\" He also said that Chidambaram will be in Parliament on Thursday at 11am. Rajasthan chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot echoed the party to say truth had prevailed. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also welcomed the Supreme Court decision, while deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said quest for truth has been vindicated and justice has finally prevailed. \"Clearly, he (Chidambaram) is a victim of vendetta politics which remains a threat to our Constitutional democracy,\" Sharma said in a tweet. Senior Congress leader Milind Deora said imprisoning an accused for 106 days is a \"travesty of justice\". \"We must not forget that bail is the rule & jail is the exception. I look forward to P Chidambaram ji\'s much-needed suggestions for tackling India\'s economic slowdown,\" he tweeted. The top court said Chidambaram can\'t leave the country without prior permission of the court and should neither try to influence the witnesses nor tamper with evidence. The apex court set aside the Delhi High Court\'s November 15 verdict denying bail to him.

The website declared that the fugitive godman has declared a \'Hindu sovereign nation\' and even has a cabinet along with a Prime Minister. It has also called for donations for the country and through it, an opportunity to gain citizenship of the \"greatest Hindu nation\", Kailaasa. According to cyber experts, the website was created on October 21, 2018 and it was last updated on October 10, 2019. The website has been registered in Panama with its IP located in US\'s Dallas. However, it is yet not clear where the \'Kailaasa\' nation is located. But the website explains: \"Kailaasa is a nation without borders created by dispossessed Hindus from around the world who lost the right to practice Hinduism authentically in their own countries.\" \"Though the Kailaasa movement is founded in the United States, and spearheaded by members of the Hindu Adi Shaivite minority community, it is created for, and offers a safe haven to all the world\'s practicing, aspiring or persecuted Hindus, irrespective of race, gender, sect, caste, or creed, where they can peacefully live and express their spirituality, arts, and culture free from denigration, interference and violence,\" it read. According to the website, the Hindu nation also has its flag known as \'Rishabha Dhvaja\', which features Swami Nithyananda himself, along with Nandi, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. Kailaasa is also set to have several government departments including education, treasury, commerce, and so on. But what stands out is a \'Department of Enlightened Civilisation\' which will work on reviving Sanatana Hindu Dharma. This \'country\' also claims to eventually have a \'Dharmic Economy\', and a Hindu Investment and Reserve Bank, where cryptocurrency will be accepted. The website also proclaims that it has its own passport and one can apply to be a citizen of Kailaasa. \"The citizens will be given a Kailaasa passport which, by the grace of Paramashiva, the holder of this passport is allowed free entry in all eleven dimensions and fourteen lokas, including Kailaasa,\" it said. Swami Nithyananda is also accused of allegedly raping his former disciple under the garb of spirituality. Last month, Gujarat Police arrested two of his associates, and also booked him under charges of abduction, wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code as well as charges under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act.

The view in the government is that concerns of other nations will need to be kept in mind while approaching the issue of data localisation as India could face reciprocal action. The intent to promote India as a major IT services destination may require that the blanket insistence of servers being physically present in India be amended. The legislation may still provide for safeguards and guarantees on access to data in case it is required by Indian agencies and will also have provisions to ensure privacy and protection against commercial exploitation. The Cabinet is also expected to take up the Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions, which intends to enhance coverage of workers. The Data Protection Bill will be studied keenly as it comes after a detailed report by a committee headed by Justice Srikrishna and recent controversies like the WhatsApp-Pegasus snooping row. The Supreme Court ruling making privacy a fundamental right has also added to the discussion on data. There have also been calls for evaluating and protecting data generated in India which is being accessed by large multinationals and social media firms. The concerns have become sharper after controversies erupted prior to the Lok Sabha polls on the role of entities like Cambridge Analytica illegally using Facebook data for political campaigns.
