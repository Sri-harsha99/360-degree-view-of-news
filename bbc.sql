(3, 'India Mumbai fires: Why does everyone only remember Kamala Mills?', '\nIn the last one month, more than 30 people have died in five separate fires in the western Indian city of Mumbai. But most people have only heard about the blaze at the trendy Kamala Mills district complex that killed 14 people. The BBC\'s Medhavi Arora explores why this is the case. \nThe outpouring of public anger that followed the massive fire which ripped through two rooftop pubs in Kamala Mills in the wee hours of 29 December shows no signs of abating. \nThe incident continues to make headlines across India, and on Thursday police announced that they had arrested three more people in connection with the incident, bringing the total number of those held to seven.\nThe attention both by the public and the media is noteworthy, given the fact that Mumbai is not new to freak accidents and infrastructure failures.  \nA fire that broke out inside a sweet shop in the city\'s Sakinaka area ten days earlier also killed 12 people, but received barely any coverage. One month later, it has been all but forgotten.\nThe twists and turns of the Kamala Mills case on the other hand, are still followed obsessively by the media. \nEyewitness Sharad Jadhav, a producer at a local news channel was an eyewitness to the fire. He was on a night shift when Mojo\'s Bistro caught fire above his office. \n\"The administration should pay attention to every such incident equally, and should not look at the wealth or the authority of the victims. They should treat everyone as human beings,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Naresh Fernandes, the Mumbai-based editor of news website scroll.in, feels that the media coverage of incidents is related to the reader demographics of the publication.\n\"There are ways in which you decide what news is. Where you are located and where your readers are located is a factor. There is a notion that the people in Kamala Mills could have been any one of our readers,\" he said.\n\"There is of course a great urban bias. Some of this has to do with the fact that people have news bureaus located in urban centres. If you\'re an editor, you\'ll be writing about things in your backyard,\" he added.\nAt the centre of the incident are two pubs -  1 Above and Mojo\'s Bistro - which have been involved in an ugly blame game over the incident. \nInitial media reports and police statements blamed 1 Above for the fire, since the 14 who died were found in the pub\'s toilet where they had died of asphyxiation.\nMeanwhile, the other pub - Mojo\'s - claimed that no deaths took place on its premises as it had followed appropriate fire safety norms.\nBut the tables turned when the Mumbai fire department released an investigation report last week, saying the embers from a hookah served at Mojos had started the fire\nThe owners of 1 Above meanwhile, alleged that the influential owners of Mojo\'s Bistro were using their authority to sway press coverage and police investigation.\nMumbai police spokesperson Deepak Deoraj on Monday confirmed to BBC that one of the owners of Mojo\'s has been arrested, as well as two managers of 1 Above. On Thursday police arrested three co-owners of 1 Above. \nMuch of the outrage around the incident has centred around what is being perceived as collusion between the city\'s municipal authorities and the influential pub owners. \nNow, business owners in Kamala Mills are concerned about the impact of the fire on their businesses.\nShripal Morakhia is the chairman of Smaaash, an entertainment arcade which has a branch in Kamala Mills.\n\"It is sad that some promoters take shortcuts which result in so many lives being lost,\" he said. \"What is sad is that authorities treat everyone as a rotten apple and such actions adversely affect investments in a sector that has the potential to generate meaningful employment.\"\nSenior journalist Siddarth Bhatia told the BBC that despite the glaring public attention he did not think there would be any changes in the long run.\nHe said even if more stringent safety rules were imposed, it would be hard to make sure businesses adhered to them.', ' Mumbai Kamala Mills Kamala Mills Mumbai Kamala Mills Sharad Jadhav Mojo Bistro Naresh Fernandes Kamala Mills Mojo Mojo Mumbai Mojos Mojo Deepak Deoraj Mojo Kamala Mills Shripal Smaaash Kamala Mills Siddarth Bhatia', '12 1 2018'),
(4, 'Karol Bagh: Seventeen die in Delhi hotel fire', '\nAt least 17 people have died in a Delhi hotel fire that broke out early on Tuesday morning, police said. \nEyewitnesses said the dead included a woman and a child who attempted to jump from a window to safety. \nOfficials said 35 people were rescued. Some were injured and have been taken to hospital.\nHotel Arpit Palace is located in Karol Bagh, an area popular with tourists for its budget hotels and shopping.  \nAt least two of those killed were Buddhist pilgrims from Myanmar (Burma), the country\'s embassy in Delhi confirmed. A number of Indian guests also died.\nVideos recorded by eyewitnesses show people jumping from the building - in one of them, a man can be seen hanging on to the side of the building before he jumps off. \n\"There was wooden panelling in the corridor, because of which people couldn\'t use the corridors to leave the hotel,\" firefighter Vipin Kenta told the Hindustan Times newspaper. \nHe said they were still investigating what caused the fire. Local media reported that most of the deaths were caused by suffocation. \nVineet Khare, BBC Hindi\nI met Somshekhar sitting on a bench outside the mortuary of Delhi\'s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where the dead and injured from the hotel fire have been taken. \nHe was gazing vacantly at TV journalists gathering information and policemen completing paperwork.\nMr Somshekhar said he had come to Delhi to attend his niece\'s wedding and was staying with his family on the second floor of the hotel.\nThe fire killed his 84-year-old mother, his brother and sister. \n\"There was a power cut at around 5am [23:30 GMT]. My sister who was in a nearby room shouted for help and asked everyone to get out. We opened the windows, but the smoke quickly filled the rooms. It all happened very quickly. There was no fire or emergency equipment,\" he said.\nMr Somshekhar\'s cousin and the bride\'s mother, Uma Nair, said she had not told her daughter, who is on her honeymoon, about the tragedy. \n\"They are in the Maldives. My daughter has read news stories about the fire and keeps calling me. I tell her everything is fine. But it\'s a matter of time before she finds out.\"\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted his condolences. \nDeeply saddened by the loss of lives due to a fire at Karol Bagh in Delhi. I convey my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. May the injured recover soon: PM @narendramodi\nEnd of Twitter post  by @PMOIndia\nFire accidents are not uncommon in Indian cities, where builders often flout safety regulations. \nMany structures, both old and new, lack proper fire exits. In recent months, officials have shut down a number of shops and restaurants in some of Delhi\'s most exclusive neighbourhoods for not following fire safety measures. \nOwners of commercial buildings have also been known to construct additional floors without the necessary permissions. \nDelhi minister Satyendra Jain told the NDTV news website that the Arpit Palace had built a fifth floor with a kitchen and a terrace, even though the owners only had permission to build four storeys. \nPTI quoted officials as saying that they had found used fire extinguishers inside the hotel, suggesting that some of those who were trapped had tried to put out the fire.

(5, 'Panipat: The Bollywood battle over an 18th Century war', '\nThe argument over a war that took place in the 18th Century began in a modern way: with a tweet.\n\"Death strikes where his shadow falls,\" wrote Sanjay Dutt, the veteran Bollywood actor who plays the Afghan leader, Ahmad Shah Abdali, in the film Panipat, which opened in cinemas on Friday.\nIt was supposed to stir up excitement for the film, which was released on Friday. Instead, it came close to instigating an international incident, angering an entire country of once-loyal Bollywood fans.\nBut what exactly has got Afghans so riled up?\nPanipat tells the story of a 1761 battle between an Indian empire and an Afghan army, led by Abdali, with the trailer leaving viewers in no doubt that this will be a high-octane ride from start to finish. \nBut it was certain to cause some controversy: after all, to Afghans Abdali is their founding father and hero, but to Indians he\'s an invader who killed thousands of Maratha warriors in the historic battle of Panipat, north of Delhi.\nConcerns were initially raised when the film was first announced. In 2017 the Afghan consulate in Mumbai reached out directly to the Indian Information and Broadcasting Ministry.\n\"Ahmad Shah Abdali holds great regard in the hearts and minds of Afghan people,\" said Naseem Sharifi, Afghanistan\'s consul general in the city. \"When the film was being made we requested to watch it without exposing the plot. Despite our constant efforts, we didn\'t get any response from the filmmakers.\"\nBut then came Sanjay Dutt\'s tweet, complete with a picture of his character, the man Afghans refer to as Ahmad Shah Baba (father). The uproar was immediate.\nIt was a wonderful experience to play such a strong & fierce character in #Panipat. See you all in the cinemas on 6th Dec. pic.twitter.com/RfJwKT3YD2\nEnd of Twitter post  by @duttsanjay\n\"He\'s vicious. He wears kohl. Abdali wasn\'t like that. From the way he dresses to the way he speaks; it\'s not even Afghan, he\'s portrayed as an Arab,\" Elaha Walizadeh, an Afghan blogger, told the BBC.\nFor generations, Afghans have grown up with Bollywood films such as Khuda Gawah, starring Amitabh Bachchan as a brave and patriotic Afghan protagonist. They were a source of joy and hope for many refugees during the dark Taliban era. They played the songs at their weddings, danced to the tunes, memorised famous dialogue and even learned Hindi from it. \nBut then came films such as the 2018 epic Padmaavat, which saw superstar Ranveer Singh playing Alauddin Khilji, a Turko-Afghan ruler who invaded and ruled Delhi in the 12th Century. Though the film garnered positive reviews, the portrayal of Khaliji as a cruel and vicious ruler offended many Afghans - although they were far from the only group to take issue.\nSimilarly Kesari, a 2019 period drama about an epic battle between 21 Sikh soldiers from the British Indian Army and more than 10,000 Afghans, was criticised for stereotyping and vilifying Afghans as invaders who forcibly took land.\nPlatforms like Twitter and Facebook mean those offended can easily find others who share their disillusionment.\n\"People are seeing the issue of misrepresentation because of social media. More young Afghans are noticing a trend and having conversations about it,\" Walizadeh said.\n\"Whereas before they were elated at the slightest mention of Afghans in Hindi movies, they now watch it with scrutiny. Though misrepresentation is a global problem, given Afghans\' relationship with Bollywood they expect better.\"\nSome film critics say however that the changing portrayal of Afghan characters could be down to more than just rising awareness on the part of Afghan filmgoers. \nInstead they link the rising number of films with negative Muslim characters as an attempt by Bollywood executives to align the industry with India\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - a Hindu nationalist party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\"We have a Hindu majority party which is quite conscious of exploiting the soft power of Bollywood,\" said Ankur Pathak, entertainment editor of Huffington Post India. \n\"Whether that is the prime minister clicking selfies with the top stars, organising meet-and-greet events or the ruling party encouraging Bollywood to show films about nation-building, there\'s an invisible incentive to make films to depict India in a positive light - and by India that means it\'s Modi\'s idea of India or the BJP\'s idea of India, which is pro-Hindu.\"\nIt is a dangerous path, Pathak adds.\n\"Misrepresentation of any community does immense damage. Given the current climate it\'s something we need to steer clear from,\" he said.\nFilm director Ashutosh Gowariker has dismissed the claims. \nHe told online channel Film Companion: \"This film is not about a Hindu-Muslim battle. It\'s about stopping an invader. It\'s about protecting your borders, your land, that\'s the patriotic theme of the film. In the wake of that we have to show that Abdali did invade but we have kept the dignity of the character.\"\nSee you guys in cinemas this Friday, as Ahmad Shah Abdali! @arjunk26 @kritisanon @AshGowariker #SunitaGowariker @RohitShelatkar @Shibasishsarkar @agppl @visionworldfilm @RelianceEnt @ZeeMusicCompany pic.twitter.com/bMNizgwtaj\nEnd of Twitter post 2 by @duttsanjay\nBut Mr Sharifi, the Afghan consul-general, remains worried about the possible fallout from Panipat - despite assurances from Sanjay Dutt that he would not have taken the role if the portrayal was negative.\nThe consul-general, who also acts as an advisor to the Afghan president, says he wants a panel of experts from both countries to review the film before its release. \nThe BBC asked Sanjay Dutt for a response to the criticism but did not receive a response. \nFor some of Bollywood\'s most loyal Afghan fans, the film is likely to disappoint.\n\"Historically Indian cinema has been instrumental in strengthening Indo-Afghan ties,\" Dr Shaida Abdali, the former Afghan ambassador to India, tweeted.\n\"I very much hope that the film \'Panipat\' has kept that fact in mind while dealing with this important episode of our shared history!\" ', ' Sanjay Dutt Bollywood Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali Panipat Afghans Afghan Abdali Afghans Abdali Maratha Panipat Mumbai Ahmad Shah Abdali Naseem Sharifi Sanjay Dutt Ahmad Shah Baba Panipat Afghan Arab Elaha Walizadeh Khuda Gawah Amitabh Bachchan Padmaavat Ranveer Singh Alauddin Khilji Delhi Khaliji Kesari Twitter Facebook Walizadeh Whereas Afghans Narendra Modi Bollywood Ankur Pathak Huffington Post India Bollywood Modi Pathak Ashutosh Gowariker Film Companion Abdali Ahmad Shah Abdali Afghan Panipat Sanjay Dutt Sanjay Dutt Bollywood Shaida Abdali', '8 12 2019'),

She had 90% burns.\nShe was attacked on Thursday as she was walking to a hearing in the rape case she filed against two men in March in Unnao, in northern Uttar Pradesh state.\nFive men, including the alleged rapists, have been arrested, Indian police say.\nThe sister of the victim, whose name has not been released, told the BBC that she wanted the death penalty for the pair.\nShe said the family would continue to fight the case against them in court.\nRape and sexual violence against women have been in focus in India since the December 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in the capital, Delhi. \nBut there has been no sign that crimes against women are abating.\nAccording to government figures, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in India in 2017, an average of 92 rapes every day.\nUnnao district has itself been in the news over another rape case. \nPolice opened a murder investigation against a ruling party lawmaker in July after a woman who accused him of rape was seriously injured in a car crash. Two of her aunts were killed and her lawyer was injured.\nSeparately, on Friday, Indian police shot dead four men suspected of raping and killing a young female vet in the southern city of Hyderabad last week.\nThat case sparked widespread outrage, and the killing of the suspects, in what rights activists believe may have been an extra-judicial killing, sparked jubilation among local residents.

(7, 'Hyderabad case: Why Indians are celebrating the killings', '\nThe killings of four men accused of gang-raping and murdering a young woman last week in Hyderabad have been largely greeted with joy in India. \nJust hours after the shootings, about 2,000 people gathered at the site to celebrate the police action. \nThey chanted \"police zindabad\" (\"hail the police\"), distributed sweets and showered flowers on the spot where the 27-year-old vet\'s charred body was found last week and where the shooting took place on Friday morning.\nIn her neighbourhood too, a large number of people gathered, setting off celebratory firecrackers and distributing sweets.\nThe celebrations and support for the police are continuing online too.\nOn Twitter, there are more than 300,000 tweets with various hashtags about the shooting and the crime, with most of the voices supportive of the police action. \nAnd there is a reason for that: the meandering pace of the Indian judicial system means it often takes years, even decades, to deliver justice. \nThere are tens of millions of pending cases in courts, including nearly 150,000 cases of rape, and this has eroded the public faith in the criminal justice system. \nThe biggest example of this in recent years is the December 2012 torture, gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi. \nThe brutal crime made global headlines, saw days of protests in Delhi and other parts of India and forced the government to enact tougher new laws, including introduction of the death penalty in rare cases.\nBut despite all that attention, the wheels of justice have turned slowly for the 23-year-old victim\'s family. \nSeven years later, her mother Asha Devi has alleged that the men, who are on death row, have used every loophole in law to delay their execution. \nNo surprises then that she was among the first people on Friday to hail the Cyberabad police:\nIn the past few years, Asha Devi has become the face of the frustration many Indians say they feel at how the system fails victims of some of the worst crimes.\nAfter last week\'s reports on the Hyderabad rape, many were articulating that same frustration again, raising concern that the rapists would \"continue to feast on our taxes\" for years while the victim\'s parents would also run from \"pillar to post\" for justice.\nIt\'s this declining faith in the system that has led many in India to demand and support instant justice. \nIt has also fuelled a craze in recent years for popular movies that show \"trigger-happy, vigilante cops\" brazenly carrying out extrajudicial executions.\nSo it was not surprising that on Friday morning, hours after the news of the shooting, one of the top Twitter trends in India was #Singham, comparing the Cyberabad policemen to the revenge-seeking police officer-hero of the 2010 Tamil film Singam, made a year later as Singham by Bollywood.\nHowever, some people have questioned Friday\'s shooting, describing it as an execution of suspects without a trial. \n\"Trigger-happy policemen with an utter disregard for the law are not the answer we seek,\" Prof Kalpana Kannabiran, from the Council for Social Development in Hyderabad, told BBC Telugu. \n\"The ends of justice are not served by wanton killing and retributive bloodlust.  The course of justice is not determined by the grief and grieving of victims\' families. \n\"Justice lies in supporting them in their moment of grief and pain and insisting on due process that brings suspects and accused to trial through a robust, stringent and competent criminal investigation.\"\nPrakash Singh, a former police officer, told the BBC that the killings were \"entirely avoidable\" and some legal experts described them as \"unconstitutional\" and asked whether justice really had been done.\nSome wondered whether the police had arrested the right men and whether they had not just picked up some poor truckers to pacify public anger. \nOne man on local TV said he found it unbelievable that all four men had had to be shot dead because they were trying to snatch the weapons of the police. \"All four?\" he kept asking.\nBut on Friday, such voices are in a minority.

Customer privacy is of paramount importance to us and we deploy the best of solutions to ensure the security of our digital platforms,\" the spokesperson added. \nThe flaw was found by independent security researcher Ehraz Ahmad. \"It took me 15 minutes to find this flaw,\" he told the BBC. \nAlong with the information above, customers\' International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers were also accessible.

This went on for 15 minutes. We retaliated and four accused got killed.\"\nTwo officers suffered head injuries but these were not caused by bullets, he added. The two police officers were admitted to hospital, he said\n\"Let me tell you this. The law has taken its own course,\" he added.\nThe police were heavily criticised after the rape and murder of the vet - particularly when the victim\'s family accused them of inaction for two hours.  \nAnalysis by G S Ram Mohan, BBC Telugu editor\nPolice \"encounter killings\" - the term for an extrajudicial killing dressed up as an unavoidable police action - are nothing new in this part of the country.\nA long-running Maoist insurgency in the 1980s and 1990s saw many those suspected of involvement with the group being killed in a similar manner. \nVC Sajjanar, the commissioner of the police division that killed the four suspects on Friday, had in fact been involved in an encounter before - an incident which played out in a strikingly similar manner.\nHe was superintendent of police when three people accused of carrying out an acid attack on a woman were killed at the scene of the crime by police. They were also taken there to \"recreate\" the crime and were reportedly shot while trying to escape. \nSupt Sajjanar received great adulation then and become a hero. \nBBC Telugu\'s Deepthi Bathini visited the family in their home, where neighbours could be seen celebrating the news by setting off firecrackers and distributing sweets. \n\"I can\'t put it into words. I felt happiness but also grief because my daughter will never come home,\" the victim\'s mother said.\n\"My daughter\'s soul is at peace now. Justice has been done. I never thought we would get justice. No other girl should experience what my daughter did.\"\nThe mother added that she wanted the law on sexual assault and rape to be stricter. \n\"Men should be scared to even stare at women - because they will be punished,\" she said.\nNews of the police action has been widely celebrated on social media. \nMany took to Twitter and Facebook to applaud the police, saying they had \"delivered justice\". \nThe mother of a student who died after being gang-raped on a bus in capital Delhi in 2012 also hailed the killing.\n\"I am extremely happy with this punishment. Police have done a great job,\" she told ANI news agency. \nBBC Telugu reporter Satish Balla, reporting from the scene of the killings, said approximately 2,000 people had gathered, causing a huge traffic jam.

(10, 'Will the world\'s \'first male birth control shot\' work?', '\nFor a long time, there have been only two contraceptive solutions which rely directly on men. \nThey can either wear a condom, or have sterilising surgery called a vasectomy to cut or seal the two tubes that carry sperm to the penis. A male birth control pill and a contraceptive gel are still in the works. \nBut India says it is going to launch the world\'s first male birth control injection soon. Will this be the male contraceptive that succeeds?\nInvented by Sujoy Guha, a maverick 78-year-old Delhi-based biomedical engineer, the drug is a single preloaded syringe shot into the tubes carrying sperm from the testicle to the penis, under local anaesthesia. The non-hormonal, long-acting contraceptive, researchers claim, will be effective for 13 years.\nAfter years of human trials, the drug called Risug, an acronym for reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance, is ready. It is a viscous gel which inactivates the sperm. The effectiveness of a second part of the treatment - an injection which dissolves the gel, hopefully reversing the effects and allowing a man to father a child - hasn\'t yet been tested in humans, though it has worked in animal studies.\nAnd, like other non-barrier methods, the contraceptive injection wouldn\'t protect against sexually-transmitted infections. \n\"This will be a world class contraceptive for men. It is safe and effective and lasts for long. We expect it will be cleared for production in the very near future,\" says RS Sharma, a reproductive biologist at the Delhi-based Indian Council of Medical Research and the drug\'s lead researcher.\nBut there are some questions over whether this is truly a reversible contraceptive.\nSome scientists say Risug is really a replacement for surgical vasectomies, something which the Indian researchers do not entirely deny.\n\"The contraceptive aspect of the drug still needs to be assessed with expanded reversibility studies. Presently it appears more like a sterilisation approach. The reversibility needed to allow the drug to become a contraceptive needs to be established,\" Michael Skinner, a reproductive biologist at Washington State University, told me. \nDr Guha agrees. \"We are not going to claim reversibility presently, although I am confident that we will be after human trials. For the moment, the drug will be positioned as an improvement on vasectomy. It will cause less trauma to men, and there will be no surgical incision,\" he says.\nEarlier this year Dr Sharma published the results of the clinical trials of the drug. Some 139 married men, under the age of 41 and having at least two children, were given a single shot of the injection and monitored for six months.\nThe wives of 133 of the men did not get pregnant after unprotected sex. The drug\'s failure to work for six of the men was blamed on \"leakage\" from the syringe, or the sperm-carrying tubes suffering punctures, according to the results.\nBut for some researchers like Stephanie Page, professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, even this seemingly paltry failure rate is significant. \"That may not be any different than scalpel vasectomy in terms of side effects and failure rate. Much more data is needed,\" Prof Page told me.\nOn the whole, Prof Page believes the crucial third trial study was \"positive\", but believes that the number of volunteers (139) was limited and the follow-up period (six months) was \"not long by most standards\".\n%\n\"Therefore the drug is a move forward but not a game changer at least for many potential markets,\" she said. \nIndian researchers say Risug has cleared three rounds of human trials - involving more than 500 volunteers since the early 1990s - manufacturing best practices and toxicity tests in the country. Two dozen studies of the drug over three decades are cited to illustrate its efficacy to prevent pregnancy.\nThe injection will be affordable and a lasting way to prevent pregnancies, they say. They say the volunteers have reported no loss of libido or major side effects. India\'s drug regulator is expected to green-light the drug soon for production and sale to the public, most likely to be undertaken by the government itself.\nIt\'s about time for an effective male birth control option. For decades, women have borne the burden of unplanned pregnancy.\nSince pregnancy and childbirth remains dangerous, the imperatives of safe and effective contraception for women have come ahead of the need for male birth control, researchers say. Scientific and social efforts have focussed on female methods.\nNearly 60 years after the first birth control pill became available in the US, women today rely on more than a dozen methods of contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies: pills and patches; injections and implants; rings and cups; and injections and sponges.\nThere is substantial international interest in Risug though.\nDr Guha has licensed the drug to a Berkeley-based non-profit, Parsemus Foundation, to launch it in the US, and a related contraceptive called Vasalgel is still in pre-clinical trails. Clinical trials of the drug are under way in six European countries. With a grant from the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation, Dr Guha, who also has a doctorate in medical physiology from Missouri\'s Saint Louis University, has been working on a variant of the drug for women, in which a similar injection into the fallopian tubes will stop pregnancies.\nSo will men play their part?\nIn patriarchal societies like India, contraceptive use among men remains low. More than 90% of married couples don\'t use condoms, according to official data. Male vasectomy rates are pitifully low; and female sterilisation remains a popular contraceptive method.\nResearchers believe attitudes might be changing worldwide.\n\"Time and attitudes are changing globally. One of the reasons men are not as involved in contraception is that they have so few options. The goal of the field is to develop a menu of contraceptives for men; only when that is available will men truly be in a place to share the burden of contraception with their partners,\" says Dr Page. Time will tell whether Risug will become the breakthrough male birth control urgently needs.\nRead more from Soutik Biswas\nFollow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC', ' Sujoy Guha Risug Risug Michael Skinner Sharma Stephanie Page Prof Page Risug Risug Guha Vasalgel Bill Melina Gates Foundation Missouri Louis University Risug Read Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik Twitter', '6 12 2019'),

Hindus generally cremate their dead, but babies and young children are often buried.\nThe villager said he had dug about 90cm (3ft) below the surface when his shovel hit the earthen pot which broke and he heard a baby crying. When he pulled out the pot, he found a baby in it.\nShe was first taken to the local government hospital but, two days later, she was moved to Dr Khanna\'s paediatric hospital which has better facilities. \nDoctors said she was a premature baby, possibly born at 30 weeks, and weighed a mere 1.1kg (2.4lb) when she was brought in. She appeared visibly shrivelled, was hypothermic and had hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n\"On Tuesday, when we handed her over to the district hospital authorities, she weighed 2.57kg [5.66lb]. She\'s accepting bottle feed and she is now totally healthy,\" Dr Khanna said on Thursday.\nIt\'s not known how long the baby lay buried under ground and doctors say they can only guess how she survived.\nDr Khanna said she might have been buried as long as \"three to four days, surviving on her brown fat\". Babies are born with fat on their abdomen, thigh and cheek and they can survive on it in an emergency for some time.\nBut other experts give a more conservative estimate - they say she could have been only buried for \"two to three hours\" and might have survived for \"another hour or two\" if she hadn\'t been rescued.  \nAn air pocket inside the pot could have provided her with oxygen or some oxygen may have filtered through the loose soil, while the fact the pot was not made of dense clay could have helped as well, they say.\nIn October, police lodged a criminal case against \"unknown persons\" and began looking for the newborn\'s parents.\nThey said they believed her parents were complicit in her burial, because even after the case was widely publicised, no-one came forward to claim her.\nOfficials have not speculated on possible motives, but India\'s gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, especially among poor communities.\nAlthough most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed after birth are not uncommon either.

(14, 'Rediscovering the forgotten Indian artists of British India', '\nThe English East India Company, founded in 1600, was established for trading. But as the powerful multinational corporation expanded its control over India in the late 18th Century, it commissioned many remarkable artworks from Indian painters who had previously worked for the Mughals. Writer and historian William Dalrymple writes about these hybrid paintings which explore life and nature.\nCalcutta in the late 1770s was Asia\'s biggest boom town: known as the City of Palaces, the East India Company\'s bridgehead in Bengal had doubled in size to 400,000 inhabitants in a decade.\nIt was now unquestionably the richest and largest colonial city in the East - though certainly not the most orderly. \n\"It would have been so easy to turn it into one of the most beautiful cities in the world,\" wrote the Count de Modave, a friend of Voltaire who passed through at this time. \"One cannot fathom why the English allowed everyone the freedom to build in the most bizarre taste, with the most outlandish planning.\"\nNor were visitors much taken by its English inhabitants. Most had come East with just one idea: to amass a fortune in the quickest possible time. \nCalcutta (now Kolkata) was a city where great wealth could be accumulated in a matter of months, then lost in minutes in a wager or at the whist table. Death, from disease or excess, was a commonplace, and the constant presence of mortality made men hard and callous. \nRising with Olympian detachment above the mercantile bawdiness of his contemporaries was the rotund figure of the chief justice of the new Supreme Court, Sir Elijah Impey.  \nA portrait of him by Johan Zoffany still hangs, a little lopsidedly, in the Calcutta High Court. It shows him pale and plump, ermine gowned and dustily bewigged.\nImpey was, however, a serious scholar and unusual in taking a serious interest in the land to which he had been posted. \nOn the journey out to India, a munshi (administrator) had accompanied him to teach him Bengali and Urdu, and on arrival the new chief justice began to learn Persian and collect Indian paintings. His house became a meeting place where the more cultured elements of Calcutta society could discuss history and literature. \nImpey and his wife Mary were also greatly interested in natural history and began to collect a menagerie of rare Indian animals. \nAt some stage in the mid-1770s, the Impeys decided to bring a group of leading Mughal artists - Sheikh Zain ud-Din, Bhawani Das and Ram Das - to paint their private zoo. \nIt was probably not the first commission of Indian artists by British patrons. \"The Study of Botany is of late Years become a very general Amusement,\" noted one enthusiast, and we know that the Scottish nurseryman James Kerr was sending Indian-painted botanical drawings back to Edinburgh as early as 1773.\nBut the Impeys\' albums of natural history painting remain among the most dazzlingly successful of all such commissions: today, a single page usually reaches prices of more than £330,000 ($387,000) at auctions, and the 197 images from the Impey Album are now widely recognised as among the very greatest glories of Indian painting.\nThis month, for the first time since the Impey Album was split up in the 18th Century, around 30 of its pages will be reassembled for a major exhibition in the Wallace Collection in London. \nForgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company celebrates some of the extraordinary work which resulted from commissions made by East India Company patrons from master Indian artists between the 1770s and 1840s. \nIt will be a unique chance to see some of the finest Indian paintings which are now scattered in private collections around the world. \nThe three artists who Impey summoned to his fine classical house in Middleton Street were all from Patna, 200 miles (320km) up the Ganges. \nThe most prolific was a Muslim, Shaikh Zain-al-Din, while his two colleagues, Bhawani Das and Ram Das, were both Hindus. \nTrained in the late Mughal style and patronised by the Nawabs of Murshidabad and Patna, they quickly learned to use English watercolours on English Watman watercolour paper, and take English botanical still lives as their models. In this way an extraordinary fusion of English and Mughal artistic impulses took place. \nZain ud-Din\'s best works reveal a superb synthesis between a coldly scientific European natural history specimen illustration, warmed with a profoundly Indian sensibility and vital feeling for nature.  \nAt his best - whether by instinct or inherited knowledge and training - he channels the outstanding Mughal achievement in natural history painting of 150 years earlier, when the great Mughal artist Mansur painted animals and birds for the Emperor Jahangir.\nNowhere are the merits of Company Painting better illustrated than in Zain ud-Din\'s astonishing portrait of a Black Headed Oriole (No. 27). \nAt first glance, it could pass for a remarkably skilful English natural history painting. Only gradually does its hybrid origins become manifest.\nThe brilliance and simplicity of the colours, the meticulous attention to detail, the gem-like highlights, the way the picture seems to glow, all these point unmistakably towards Zain ud-Din\'s Mughal training. \nAn idiosyncratic approach to perspective also hints at this background: the tree trunk is rounded, yet the grasshopper which sits on it is as flat as a pressed flower, with only a hint of outline shading to give it depth - the same technique used by Mansur.\nYet no artist working in a normal Mughal atelier would have placed his bird detached from a landscape against a white background, with the jackfruit tree on which its sits cut into a perfect, scientific cross-section. \nEqually no English artist would have thought of painting the bark of that cross section the same brilliant yellow as the oriole; the tentative washes of a memsahib\'s watercolour are a world away. \nThe two traditions have met head on, and from that blinding impact an inspirational new fusion has taken place.\nBhawani Das, who seems to have started off as an assistant to Zain ud-Din, is almost as fine an artist as Zain ud-Din. \nHe is acutely sensitive to shape, texture and expression, as for example in his celebrated study of a great fruit bat with the contrast between its soft, furry body with the angular precision of its blackly outstretched wings, as if it were some caped Commendatore ushering a woman into a Venetian opera rather than a creature in a colonial menagerie. \nNow, for the first time, the work of these great Indian artists painting in this brilliantly hybrid Anglo-Indian style are beginning to get the attention they deserve. \nThe first-ever museum show of this work in the UK aims to highlight and showcase the work of a series of extraordinary Indian artists, each with their own style and tastes and agency. Indeed the greatest among them - such as Zain ud-Din- deserve to be remembered as among the most remarkable Indian artists of all time.\nWilliam Dalrymple is the author, most recently, of The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company and Forgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company (Bloomsbury)', ' William Dalrymple East India Company Bengal Count Modave Voltaire Sir Elijah Impey Johan Zoffany Calcutta High Court Impey Bengali Urdu Mary Impeys Mughal Sheikh Zain Bhawani Das Ram Das James Kerr Impeys Impey Album Impey Album Wallace Collection London East India Company Impey Middleton Street Patna Muslim Shaikh Zain-al-Din Bhawani Das Ram Das Nawabs Murshidabad Patna English Watman English Mughal Mansur Emperor Jahangir Black Headed Oriole Mughal Mansur Bhawani Zain William', '30 11 2019'),

But Ravi Kumar\'s quest for a document granting him legal recognition for his status has got him into trouble with the authorities. The BBC\'s Geeta Pandey reports from Tohana village in northern India.\nWith two large tattoos that declare him to be an \"atheist\" covering his forearms, 33-year-old Ravi Kumar says he realised there was no God when he was just six or seven.\n\"On Diwali every year my father bought a lottery ticket and prayed to the Goddess Lakshmi but he never hit the jackpot. And then one day, four boys were beating me up and I prayed to Lord Krishna for help, but he didn\'t come to my rescue,\" he says. \nSitting at his two-room home in Tohana, about 250km (155 miles) from the capital, Delhi, he shows me his \"most prized possession\" - a certificate that says he belongs to \"no caste, no religion and no God\".\nIssued on 29 April on a Haryana government letterhead, it is signed by a local Tohana official. \nBut unfortunately for him, the authorities revoked it a week later - they said they had \"exceeded their jurisdiction\" and asked him to return it. \nRavi Kumar refused and instead filed an appeal in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. \nIn September, the high court dismissed his petition. The judge said that Article 25 of the constitution guaranteed him \"the right to claim that he is an atheist\" but that there really was no legal requirement for such a certificate.\nA college dropout who makes a living by painting houses, Ravi Kumar says he\'s not giving up - he is preparing to appeal against the high court ruling and has also written to the Indian president seeking his help.\n\"The high court says there is no need for me to have a certificate, but there is,\" he insists. \"When the government issues religion or caste certificates to people, I too have the right to have a certificate that identifies me as an atheist. I\'m also a citizen of this country.\"\nIn India, you need a religion certificate only if you change your faith. And caste certificates are given to those who belong to disadvantaged groups and would like to avail of the quota in government jobs or universities.\nRavi Kumar\'s family does belong to a disadvantaged caste grouping but he\'s sworn that he will never sign up for any benefits.\nThe reason he wants his certificate is essentially to make a statement.\nIt was in September 2017 that he began the legal process by filing a plea in a local court, asking that he should be allowed to use atheist as the last element in his name.\nThree months later, on 2 January 2018, the civil judge ruled in his favour: the order said he had the right to be identified as \"Ravi Kumar Atheist\" in his official records.\nAfter he had his name changed in his school leaving certificate, his birth certificate, national identity card and bank cards, he approached the authorities for a \"no caste, no religion and no God certificate\".\nAnd he got one.\nBut once his story was reported by news channels, the officials realised that they had \"exceeded their jurisdiction\" - and said it was not for them to say whether God existed or not.\nThey asked him to return the document and promised to replace it with a modified one describing him as a caste-less atheist - which he refused.  \nAccording to census data, 33,000 Indians identify themselves as atheists - a mere handful in a country of 1.3 billion. \nReligion and religious identity dominate most aspects of life in India, especially in the past decade with an upsurge in Hindu nationalism, and most atheists keep their beliefs to themselves. Speaking out of turn can be dangerous - many complain of being shunned by friends and family and, in an extreme case in 2017, an outspoken atheist and rationalist was hacked to death in southern India. \nBut Ravi Kumar literally wears his belief, or the lack of it, on his sleeve, in the form of tattoos and the word atheist that he has taken on as his surname.\nHe also openly challenges the existence of God and, whenever an opportunity presents, he asks people to shun religion.\n\"No-one has been able to prove the existence of God,\" he says, adding, \"because there IS no God. God is man\'s creation. God doesn\'t exist. It is just a word.\" \nRavi Kumar grew up in a fairly religious home: his parents and grandfather were devout Hindus who would visit temples and perform rituals on religious festivals.\n\"My father took me to temples and as a child I went in because I was curious to see what was there.\"\nHis mother would tell him that they worshipped Goddess Lakshmi on Diwali so that they would become prosperous, and his grandfather who had read the Hindu holy book Gita told him that Lord Krishna would save him if he was ever in trouble. \nAs he grew older, he says he became aware that \"religion and caste differences were being used by politicians and religious leaders to fool people and prey on their weaknesses\".\nHe tells me he hasn\'t visited a temple in almost 20 years and argues that the money spent on temples, mosques and other religious institutions would be better spent building schools and hospitals.\nFor his belief in atheism, he says he was picked on during his school and college years and that he also lost work opportunities. Many friends and relatives shunned him and his neighbours called him crazy. He says he\'s still single because no family is willing to give their daughter to a man who doesn\'t believe in God and wants to marry not according to religious practices but in a court.\nHis parents tell me initially they also found his lack of belief unpalatable. His father, Inder Lal, who works as a carpenter in a factory, says he felt hurt and humiliated when people called his son nastik (atheist). \"I once felt so upset that I left home thinking I would kill myself, but then I changed my mind and came back.\"\nBut now, he\'s a convert to atheism too. \"I see his point. Now we don\'t do any religious rituals at home. We have also stopped going to the temple.\" \nIn the past two years, as the local press has reported his fight to be legally recognised as an atheist, Ravi Kumar has been transformed into a minor celebrity.\n\"People call me from faraway places, some even visit me - they say they\'re atheists too, some say like me they too want to take atheist as their surname.\" \nRavi Kumar says his atheism has convinced him that much of the world\'s problems are rooted in religion.\n\"India and Pakistan use religion to justify conflict, the world is on the brink of World War Three. People say they believe in religion, but they lie 24 hours a day, they think bad thoughts, they use swords and guns to kill and maim.

(20, 'Behind India\'s construction boom: \'We risk our lives to build your homes\'', '\nIt was an early morning in November when Mir Hasan arrived at a construction site in Noida - a suburb of India\'s capital Delhi - to start his daily shift.\nHe drank a bottle of water and began work right away - this was his routine every day. \nBut a few hours later, he fell from the high-rise building and died.\nHe should have had a harness, a good protective helmet, boots with a firm grip and an insurance policy against accidents. But he did not have any of these things, which construction firms are legally required to give workers.\nHowever, many firms do not follow the rules in order to save money, and end up neglecting the wellbeing of the very people who form the backbone of their business.\nMir Hasan\'s death wasn\'t an isolated incident - more than five workers died in 2018 in Noida in a similar manner, and many more suffered injuries.\nRam Bhavan, who has worked at many construction sites in Noida, says most contractors and builders do not take the safety of workers seriously.\n\"Sometimes, we get helmets but they are mostly old and ill-fitting, and boots are not of good quality,\" he says. \"Each worker is aware of the risks and we get scared when we hear about other workers\' deaths. But we don\'t have an option - we have to keep working without safety equipment.\"\nRam left Delhi last year to work at construction sites in Allahabad city in northern India. \n\"The deaths of my colleagues scared me\" he says. \"I now work at smaller construction sites where working conditions are still risky but manageable.\" \nThe invisible workforce - stories about the unorganised workers at the heart of India\'s economy\nThe construction sector, which mostly relies on unorganised labour, is one of India\'s biggest job providers. India has seen a construction boom in recent years as incomes rise and cities expand. \nBut the industry mostly attracts migrant workers from villages who move to towns and cities due to a lack of jobs in their own areas. \nFor any labourer refusing to work without proper safety equipment, there will be 100 others willing to take the job. And so construction firms seldom fear losing their workforce, and hire and fire frequently. \nP Sainath, the founder and editor of the journal People\'s Archive of Rural India, says an agrarian crisis has also contributed to the constant migration of labourers from villages to cities.\n\"Farming has become unsustainable because of the poor policies of governments. And that is why [the] agrarian workforce is rapidly moving to the construction sector,\" he says.\nAtul Kumar is currently working on a construction project in Noida. He came to the city from a village in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh after farming became costly and unsustainable.\n\"I wasn\'t making enough money in farming. As a construction worker, I earn anything between 200 to 300 rupees (£3.50; $4.50) a day. Yes, construction work is risky but it feeds my family,\" he said.\nI visited many construction sites in Noida and Allahabad, and spotted labourers working without proper safety equipment. And when we tried to speak to the managers at these sites, we were denied entry.\nI met Rakesh Kumar (who did not want to use his real name) living in a temporary hut with his family near a construction site. His two children were playing outside with sand used for building. \nThe hut, which had a plastic sheet as a roof, had just enough room for four people to sleep. \n\"It gets terribly cold in the night and my children suffer so much,\" he said. \"I can\'t even afford to send them to school. All this worries me but then arranging two meals a day for them becomes more important than educating them.\" \nHe added that contractors often abuse labourers when they ask for safety gear. \"Sometimes we are beaten up as well.\"\nGayadin, 55, started working in the construction sector when he was 15 years old.\n\"My back now hurts after years of manual labour,\" he says. \"But I don\'t have any other skills. I have resigned to the fate and have no hopes from any government. I am trying to save whatever little I can for a time when my body won\'t allow me to do manual work.\" \nGayadin can\'t ask for a higher wage because there is a lot of demand for these jobs.  \nMr Sainath says this is one of the reasons that construction firms prefer to hire workers from faraway places.\n\"Migrant labourers come from different parts of the country and never pose the risk of forming a union to demand better wages or safety equipment,\" he says. \"Locals on the other hand can easily form unions.\" \nMigrant workers also lack resources to take any legal action or demand compensation after accidents. \n\"As long as firms continue to prefer migrant labourers, the influx will continue and nobody will bother about their safety,\" Ms Sainath says.\nDeath is not the only risk. Workers are also constantly exposed to dust from the construction site coupled with toxic levels of air pollution.\n\"I struggle to breathe and cough constantly,\" says 25-year-old Dilip Kumar, a construction worker who suffers from respiratory illnesses.\n\"But I don\'t pay attention to all this. I want to work hard, save up and then open a small shop in my village. I am not sure if my dream will come true but I will keep dreaming.\"\nWomen workers face different challenges. \nRina Kumari, who works in Allahabad, says builders don\'t hire women and whenever they do, they prefer younger women.\n\"They think women can\'t work as much as men, so most days I go without any work or settle for a lower daily wage,\" she says. \"My husband left me, so I have to work for my children.\"\nSo what can be done to keep construction workers safe?\nRajat Sodhi, founder of architecture firm Orproject, says contractors need to invest in safety measures.\n\"In developed countries, most firms have a health safety department and an emergency health worker is always present at the site. But this costs money and most Indian contractors don\'t want to spend extra,\" he says.\nHe says that while the situation is slowly getting better, existing rules need to be properly implemented. \nBN Singh, the district magistrate of Noida, acknowledges that some construction firms are not following proper health and safety norms.\nHe says part of the problem is a lack of awareness. \n\"Most migrant workers move from place to place and it becomes difficult for us to make them aware of government schemes,\" he says. \"We are also trying to get firms and labourers to formally register with us because it ensures that they get proper compensation.\"\nKhesari Lal, who has been a construction worker for 20 years, says he has heard about health benefits and other schemes, but doesn\'t know how to access them.\n\"We want the government to help us, but we also want people to change their attitudes towards us,\" he says.  \n\"We are considered untouchables, people don\'t even talk to us nicely. Little do they know that we risk death every day to build their beautiful homes - the kind we can never dream of living in.\" \nPhotographs and additional reporting by Ankit Srinivas\nThis is the second story in a three-part series about the millions of informal workers who help Indian cities function.', ' Mir Hasan Noida Delhi Mir Ram Noida Ram Delhi Allahabad P People Atul Kumar Noida Uttar Pradesh Noida Allahabad Rakesh Kumar Dilip Kumar Allahabad Rajat Orproject Singh Noida Khesari Ankit Srinivas', '7 1 2019'),

(25, 'Padmaavat: Why a Bollywood epic has sparked fierce protests', '\nThe controversial Bollywood epic, Padmaavat, has prompted months of protests across India. \nThe film tells the story of a 14th Century Hindu queen and a Muslim ruler. The BBC explains why Hindu right-wing and caste groups believe it distorts history.\nBollywood stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh play the lead roles. \nThe film tells the story of 14th Century Muslim emperor Alauddin Khilji\'s attack on a kingdom after he was smitten by the beauty of its queen, Padmavati, who belonged to the Hindu Rajput caste. \nHindu groups and a Rajput caste organisation allege that the movie includes an intimate scene in which the Muslim king dreams of becoming intimate with the Hindu queen. \nDirector Sanjay Leela Bhansali has said the film does not feature such a \"dream sequence\" at all. \nBut rumours of such a scene were enough to enrage right-wing Hindu groups who called for the film to be banned.\nWhile Khilji is a historical figure, most historians believe there is very little evidence Padmavati existed in real life. But some historians, largely based in Rajasthan, disagree.\nThe name of the queen, and the plot of the film, are believed to be based on an epic poem, Padmaavat, by 16th-Century poet  Malik Muhammad Jayasi, who himself described the work as fiction.\nThe poem extols the virtue of Padmavati who committed jauhar to protect her honour from Khilji who had killed her husband, the Rajput king, in a battle.\nJauhar, the mass self-immolation by women to avoid enslavement and rape by foreign invaders, is believed to have originated some 700 years ago among the ruling class or Rajputs in India. \nWomen in the community burnt themselves after their men were defeated in battles to avoid being taken by the victors. But it came to be seen as a measure of wifely devotion in later years. \nHistorians point out that Jayasi\'s ballad was written more than 200 years after the historical record of the invasion by Khilji. They say the folklore around Padmavati has been problematic as they have glorified sati.\nBut Padmavati is deified and held as a symbol of female honour among Rajputs even today.\nThere have been protests over the film in different parts of the country since January 2017 when members of the Karni Sena, a Rajput caste group, vandalised the set and slapped Mr Bhansali. \nThe protests intensified in November as the movie\'s original date of release - 1 December - approached. \nRajput community members burnt effigies of Mr Bhansali.\nThe Karni Sena vandalised cinemas and threatened to chop off Ms Padukone\'s nose, referring to a story in the epic Ramayana where a character has her nose chopped off as punishment.\nThe group also held protests against the film in several states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, which are governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.\nRajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said the film should not be released until \"necessary changes are made so that sentiments of any community are not hurt\".\nA regional leader of the BJP announced a reward of nearly $1.5m (£1.3m) for anyone who beheaded Mr Bhansali and Ms Padukone. \nSome former royals in Rajasthan also called for the film\'s release to be cancelled. One of them, Mahendra Singh, said it was \"an artistic and historic fraud to portray an incorrectly attired courtesan-like painted doll in the song as the very \"queen\" the film purports to pay obeisance to\" - referring to a song in which Padmavati is dancing. Such scenes would lead to \"anarchy,\" he added.    \nEarlier this week, protesters in India\'s western state of Gujarat blocked roads, torched buses and vandalised a theatre after the Supreme Court cleared the release of the film. \nOn 18 January, the court cleared the film\'s release and overturned the decision by four states to ban it, citing fears of violence. \nThe film\'s producers had approached the Supreme Court to challenge the states\' ban. \n\"Cinemas are an inseparable part of right to free speech and expression,\" said Chief Justice Dipak Misra. \"States... cannot issue notifications prohibiting the screening of a film.\"\nThe court added in its ruling that the states should not have banned the film as it had already been cleared by India\'s censor board.\nThe board had screened the film to historians, who suggested five modifications. One of them included changing the film\'s name from Padmavati to Padmaavat, after the 16th Century epic poem of the same name. \nAdditional reporting by Sudha G Tilak\nUpdate 16 May 2018: This article has been amended to clarify that while most Indian historians believe there is very little evidence Padmavati existed in real life, some historians, largely based in Rajasthan, disagree.', ' Padmaavat Hindu Deepika Padukone Ranveer Singh Alauddin Khilji Padmavati Hindu Rajput Rajput Muslim Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali Khilji Padmavati Rajasthan Padmaavat Malik Muhammad Jayasi Padmavati Khilji Rajputs India Jayasi Khilji Padmavati Padmavati Rajputs Karni Sena Ramayana Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh Haryana Hindu Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje Rajasthan Mahendra Singh Gujarat Dipak Misra Padmavati Padmaavat Sudha G Tilak Padmavati Rajasthan', '25 1 2018');

(26, '#MeToo firestorm consumes Bollywood and Indian media', '\nIndia\'s #MeToo movement arrived in a cascade of allegations as women took to Twitter to call out comedians, journalists, authors, actors and filmmakers - in the process, they have sparked a debate about consent and complicity. \nUnlike its American counterpart, it has not been spurred by investigative journalism. Rather, it has been a spontaneous outpouring in the last few days, amplified by journalists themselves. And it has hit Indian media the hardest.  \nVeteran actor Alok Nath is the latest to be named for an alleged sexual assault nearly 20 years ago. His accuser, the director of a television show starring Nath, recounted the alleged incident in a Facebook post that has since gone viral. \n\"Neither I am denying this nor do I would agree with it. It [rape] must have happened, but someone else would have done it,\" Mr Nath is quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper. Meanwhile, the association of TV actors has promised an inquiry into the matter. \nIt\'s difficult to say what sparked the torrent of allegations. But it seems to have started on 4 October when a young female comedian accused Utsav Chakraborty, a 33-year-old comedian, of sending her an unsolicited photo of his penis. More allegations followed as other women replied to her tweet or she shared private messages they sent her (with their names blurred) - they said he had either sent them photos of his penis or asked them for naked photos of themselves. \nMr Chakraborty, who admitted to the accusation in a series of tweets, apologised the next day. By then, more women, many of them journalists, had begun to share stories of sexual harassment and even assault.  \nIn the next three days, as more comedians, senior reporters, editors, popular authors, actors and filmmakers were \"outed\", the hashtag #MeToo was trending in India. The scores of tweets - in the form of long \"threads\" and screenshots of incriminating conversations - have set off a debate about what constitutes harassment, complicity and consent. \nThis is not the first time alleged harassers have been publicly named and shamed in India - in 2017, a law student published a controversial crowdsourced list on Facebook accusing more than 50 professors. But this time, most of the accusers are not anonymous. And those that have chosen to remain anonymous are not alone in their accusations.\nWomen journalists have perhaps played the biggest role so far, \"outing\" reporters, senior editors, authors and even a high court judge. And it\'s likely the coming week will bring fresh accusations. \nOk just got a google doc of names some one collated of alleged perpetrators named in public. I’m a little shaken. Over 100, many familiar names. I’m not going to make it public. This isn’t a witch-hunt. But there will be proper follow-up. This is India’s #MeToo moment.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @MasalaBai\n\"So many allegations have come out and organisations are slowly realising that this is wrong and something has to be done,\" Dhanya Rajendran, editor of The News Minute, told the BBC\'s Divya Arya.\n\"But this is just a start. This is the first step to give women a safe working environment,\" she added.\nThe allegations have made it to the front page of national dailies, forcing newsrooms to not just take notice but also respond. At least one major newspaper has promised an investigation after seven women accused one of its senior editors of sexually harassing them and of sabotaging their careers if they did not comply; another newspaper announced that a senior editor who had been named was stepping down from his role. \n\"There were whispers all along in the newsrooms of misconduct by senior editorial colleagues who used their positions of power and influence to proposition and harass young women, but now some of it\'s being articulated in the open,\" says the BBC\'s Geeta Pandey. \nJournalist Sandhya Menon, who has called out two senior editors for allegedly sexually harassing her, has shared numerous stories of harassment and assault from other women - many of whom messaged her privately. \nI\'m inundated with DMs about all sorts of misconduct  and the scope and universe of  what I was talking about has expanded horrifically. I\'m mortified that men treat women  with such immense callousness. I\'ve been thinking for over 24 hours about what I should do with those DMs\nEnd of Twitter post  by @TheRestlessQuil\nSince then, many more women have come forward with their stories, some of them from years ago. This is perhaps a sign of how, for the first time, they believe people are listening. \n\"They are using their words, smartphones and laptops to speak their truth and be heard,\" says Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy. \nShe said it was a form of \"civil disobedience\" because, having lost faith in the justice of public institutions, they were making use of the tools available to them.\nIndia\'s film industry has hovered on the edges of #MeToo for some time. In September, a 10-year-old allegation by actress Tanushree Dutta against veteran actor Nana Patekar once again made headlines but, for the first time, it attracted the attention of several people in the film industry. Patekar repeated his denial of the allegations over the weekend, calling them \"a lie\".\nMany of my co-workers,female and male have been harassed and bullied, but it’s their story to tell. If we don’t encourage their voices and instead vilify and question them, how will victims ever become survivors? Let them speak up! Stand up with them!\nEnd of Twitter post  by @sonamakapoor\nThen on 6 October HuffPost India published a months-long investigation alleging that director Vikas Bahl had sexually assaulted a female crew member in 2015. It also alleged that his business partners, including acclaimed director, Anurag Kashyap, knew about the allegation but took no action against Mr Bahl.\nMr Bahl, who denied the allegation after it first surfaced, has not commented publicly since the HuffPost story on Saturday. \nWhile actresses have spoken out before they often did not name their harasser or their allegations did not become part of a larger movement. Although the accuser remains anonymous, this is the first time such an allegation has been made public in Bollywood. \nIt has also been corroborated by Mr Kashyap, who has issued an apology, vowing that something like this will \"never happen again\" on his \"work premises\".  This is no minor development in an industry which has long been criticised for exploiting women both on the screen and off it. \nPhantom, the production house set up by Mr Kashyap, Mr Bahl and two others, was dissolved on 6 October. It produced the Netflix show Sacred Games along with several Bollywood films. \nThe alleged victim had not wanted to speak out until now, Mr Kashyap said, so the company had not acted sooner.  \"Now in hindsight and after taking stock of things myself, I can quite see how I was ill-advised.\" \nThe allegations have ranged from awkward or creepy encounters, lewd behaviour and suggestive text messages to aggressive sexual advances and outright assault. This has prompted some women to ask others to use caution before calling someone out on Twitter for something \"trivial\".\nBut this has also invited criticism from other women who have argued in favour of a stricter definition of consent. Some have said this is a moment to listen, sift through stories and introspect rather than tell women how they should process what happened to them. \nThose who were allegedly complicit have also not been spared the naming and shaming. Mr Chakraborty, for instance, had appeared in videos by India\'s most popular comedy group, All India Bakchod (AIB). Co-founder Tanmay Bhat, who admitted to the charge that he knew about the alleged incident, has stepped down from his role as CEO.\nAfter confronting Utsav, he said he sent the picture by accident, later called the victim crying, apologizing, hence harassing her further. I should\'ve ended ties then, and I didn\'t, and it is my fault. I\'m truly sorry. I should\'ve acted stronger.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @thetanmay\nSince then, a film produced by AIB has been dropped from the prestigious Mumbai film festival while a third season of a television show featuring the group was cancelled by popular Indian streaming website Hotstar. \nAnd the allegations of complicity have also unleashed a public reckoning. \nIt\'s a serious failure of the entire comedy community if things have come to this stage. We had a new industry that could have been easily taught the meaning of equality & respect. We blew that chance. Ashamed.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @varungrover\n#MeToo is a minefield of novel heartbreaks.I\'ve theorised often: \"What if my own friends are named? What will I say? What will I do?\" No theorising prepares you.A reckoning, a gut-punch: men who have been good to you have been terrible to other women.Both things are true.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @RegaJha\nGeeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\nThe floodgates have opened and what\'s coming out is predictably murky. \nMany are describing it as Indian journalism\'s #MeToo moment, but could it really be as potent as the movement that brought down some of the most powerful men of Hollywood?  The names that have been outed, barring one or two, are of relatively small fry - the \"Harvey Weinsteins\" remain unnamed as yet.\nThe strength of the latest #MeToo movement will ultimately be tested by where it travels from here - and if the past is any indication, there\'s not much to be optimistic about, for earlier attempts at an Indian #MeToo did not have any lasting impact. \nA list of alleged predators in academia died a quick death in the Twitter bubble; and calls to name and shame the sleazy in Bollywood did not find many takers.

She has acted in erotic thrillers and adult comedies, and is often portrayed as a sex symbol. \nSo perhaps it\'s not surprising that men from across India - and even the world - are calling Mr Agarwal because they believe it is really her number. \nAnd Mr Agarwal is tired of it. \"They [the film\'s producers] should have at least called to check if it\'s a real number,\" he told BBC Hindi\'s Bhumika Rai.\nThe director of Arjun Patiala, Rohit Jugraj Chauhan, declined to comment. \nIn the week since the film hit the screens, Mr Agarwal hasn\'t been able to work, sleep or even eat his meals in peace. \nBut giving up a phone number that he\'s had for years is not an option, he says. \"It\'s connected to my business and many old friends have this number.\" \nHe received the first call on the day of the film\'s release. The caller asked to speak to Leone and wouldn\'t believe Mr Agarwal when he told him he had dialled the wrong number. An irritated Mr Agarwal eventually hung up.\n\"The first two, three, even 10 calls, I thought someone was playing a prank on me. I thought maybe it was a friend of mine. \" \nBut the calls kept coming - and they all asked him the same question: \"Can I speak to Sunny Leone?\" \nHe started to realise what was really going on after many of the callers referred to the film. \"So I watched the movie and my number was really there,\" Mr Agarwal says. \"It wasn\'t the fault of the callers. They really were given my number!\"\nHe says he tried to register a police complaint but the police were unable to help since the callers were not committing a criminal offence. Instead, they suggested that he approach a court. Mr Agarwal has since filed a petition to have his number removed from the film. \nHe doesn\'t want to sue the producers but says he just wants to make sure his phone number isn\'t publicised further - such as when the film becomes available on streaming networks. He also says he wants to prevent this from happening to anyone else. \n\"The mornings are quiet until about 08:30,\" he says. Then the calls start. \nAfter that, the phone rings every two to three minutes for the rest of the day, making it impossible for him to concentrate on anything he is doing. \nMost of the calls are from the northern Indian states of Punjab or Haryana since the film\'s lead actor, Diljit Dosanjh, is popular in that region. But Mr Agarwal has also received calls from Italy, Dubai, Pakistan and Australia. \nHis most persistent caller, however, has been from New Zealand. When Mr Agarwal didn\'t answer the phone, the caller began messaging him on WhatsApp, harassing him to accept a video call. When Mr Agarwal refused, the man sent photos of himself and asked for them to be shown to Leone and for photos of her to be sent to him.\nSo far, all but two callers have been men. The women wanted to speak to any actor, not Leone. \"When I said I cannot help her, one of the women asked me to speak to her for some time. I said that would not be possible and hung up,\" he says, laughing. \nBut the calls can quickly turn dark - and there is regular verbal abuse. \"It starts politely. But once I say I don\'t know her, they start abusing me. They say they know where I live and they will come teach me a lesson.\"\nHe says the whole incident has become so absurd that his friends, colleagues and neighbours now tease him - they call him \"Delhi\'s Sunny Leone\" and sing her hit songs when they see him.\n\"It\'s become a joke and that\'s fine, but this shouldn\'t happen again,\" he says. \"I try to laugh it off but it has got out of control.\"\nHe hopes the calls will stop soon. In the meantime, he\'s found a solution to keep the calls short. \"I just tell them she\'s gone to have a bath and cannot speak right now.\"', ' Bollywood Arjun Patiala Sunny Leone Puneet Agarwal Agarwal Bollywood Agarwal Bhumika Rai Arjun Patiala Rohit Jugraj Chauhan Agarwal Sunny Leone Punjab Haryana Diljit Dosanjh Dubai Agarwal Leone Leone Delhi', '2 8 2019'),
(28, 'Why India\'s rape crisis shows no signs of abating', '\nThe police in India are looking for the rapists of a girl who has no face, name, home or number.\nShe was possibly between nine and 11 years old, and her mutilated corpse was found in a bush recently near a playground in western Gujarat state\'s bustling Surat city, known the world over for its diamond polishing industry. Her battered body bore 86 injury marks. The autopsy surgeon believes that the injuries \"seem to have been caused over a period ranging from one week to a day prior to the recovery of the body\".\nThe police believe she was held captive, tortured and ravaged. More than 10 days after they found her body, they are clueless about her identity: they have trawled the list of some 8,000 missing children in the state and come up with nothing. \"There was no sign of struggle at the spot where the body was found,\" the local police chief says.\nPutting up a struggle seems to be futile when rape is increasingly used as an instrument to assert power and intimidate the powerless in India. This is not surprising, many believe, in a hierarchical, patriarchal and increasingly polarised society, where hate is being used to divide people and harvest votes. \nAn awful sex ratio imbalance - largely because of illegal sex-selection abortions - means it is a country full of men. The country sees 112 boys born for every 100 girls, which is against the natural sex ratio of 105 boys for every 100 girls. A preference for boys has meant that more than 63 million women are statistically \"missing\". Many believe such skewed ratios can contribute to increased crimes against women.  \nThe northern state of Haryana, which records the highest number of gang rapes in India, has the worst sex ratio in the country. In January alone, a 50-year-old man was held for mutilating a 10-year-old girl, a 15-year-old boy allegedly raped a three-and-a-half-year-old girl, a 20-year-old married women was raped by two men, a 24-year-old man was held for kidnapping and abducting a student and a minor\'s girl\'s brutalised body was found in the fields. And these were only the reported cases.  \nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, a poisonous cocktail of biology and bigotry led to the macabre rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim nomadic girl in January. She was kidnapped, kept captive in a Hindu temple, raped repeatedly and dumped in a forest. It was a warning to the minority Muslim nomads in the area to stop grazing their animals on Hindu owned land, in a restive part of the region, which is simmering with religious tensions. \nEight Hindu men have been charged with the Kashmir gang-rape and murder. Their trial began in a fast track court on Monday. Two ministers from the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP who openly attended a rally in support of the accused resigned after the rising outrage forced the party\'s hand and compelled Prime Minister Narendra Modi to condemn the incident - on Twitter. \nIn the southern state of Kerala, a bank manager declared on his Facebook wall that it was \"good\" that the nomad girl was killed, because \"she would have come as a [human] bomb against India tomorrow\". His employers sacked him.\nMr Modi has tweeted that India\'s \"daughters will get justice\". His assurances, many believe, have begun to ring hollow. (Lawmakers belonging to his own party are being accused of rape, and supporting men accused of rape, and action is only taken against them only after widespread condemnation of their behaviour.) \nOther politicians haven\'t done much better. When three men were convicted in 2014 for the gang rape of a journalist, Mulayam Singh Yadav, leader of the regional Samajwadi Party said: \"Boys make mistakes. They should not hang for this. We will change the anti-rape laws.\" \nIndian women have to reconcile themselves with the reality: you save yourself - dress up properly, don\'t go out unescorted or simply stay at home - or remain unsaved. \nWhat is disturbing is what appears to be the rising number of children who are being targeted. India\'s crime records show that reported rapes of minor children had more than doubled between 2012 and 2016. \nMore than 40% of the country\'s female victims were minor children. The uptick could, however, have something to do with increased and better reporting by the police and media, and widening the definition of rape after the horrific 2012 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi. \nIndia is not alone when it comes to high rates of incidence of rape. But many believe patriarchy and a skewed sex ratio may be making matters worse. There is public apathy as well: the rights and security of women never become election issues. \nRape can also be ingrained and justified in cultures. When Goths attacked Rome in 410 AD St Augustine called wartime rape an \"ancient and customary evil\". An ancient Indian treatise, according to American Indologist Wendy Doniger, \"legitimised rape as a form of marriage and gave some degree of legal sanction, retroactively, to women who had been raped\".\nSo has nothing much changed after the 2012 Delhi gang rape sparked global outrage and violent public protests? \nIt is difficult to say. The good news is that there is higher and better reporting of rape. The bad news is that a shambolic criminal justice system remains vulnerable to political pressures and allows many of the accused to go scot free - only one in four cases of rape in India end in conviction. \nAlso many Indians - men and women - refuse to believe that sexual violence is a serious problem eating away at India\'s vitals. And most political parties, including Mr Modi\'s BJP, don\'t appear to recognise and treat it as the crippling societal crisis it is.

(29, 'Was Delhi gang rape India\'s #Metoo moment?', '\nFive years after the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year old physiotherapy student on a bus in Delhi, the BBC\'s Geeta Pandey asks if India is a better place for women today.\nFirst, a recap of the horrific crime - the young woman and her male friend had boarded the bus just after 9pm on 16 December 2012. \nShe was then gang-raped by the driver and five other men on the bus while her friend was badly beaten up. Naked and bloodied, the couple were thrown by the roadside to die. \nThey were taken to hospital after some passers-by found them and called the police. She clung to life for a fortnight before succumbing to her injuries. Her friend lives, scarred for life.\nThe brutality of the assault stunned India and the press dubbed her Nirbhaya - the fearless one.\nBut I had met my own Nirbhaya a decade before that, while I was producing a BBC radio feature on rape in India.\nI met her at a shelter for women run by an NGO in central Delhi. She was from a poor family in Gujarat, a member of a travelling tribe that has no fixed address. \nThe woman had come to the capital along with her husband and young child.\nFor a few months the couple had worked as day wage labourers and were returning to Gujarat for a visit.\nAt the railway station, in the melee, she was separated from her family. They boarded the train as it moved and she got left behind.\nAs she sat on the platform weeping, a kindly looking Sikh man offered help. He told her he was a truck driver and would take her home. \nShe took him up on his offer since she had no money.\nFor the next four days, she was driven around on the truck, brutally gang-raped by the driver and three other men. \nBelieving that she was about to die, they threw her by the roadside which is where she was found and taken to hospital.\nWhen I went to meet her, she had just been brought in from the hospital after months of treatment. \nHer body resembled a war zone. Her insides were so badly damaged that she had to walk around with a pipe that came out of her abdomen and was attached to a bag. She showed me burn marks on her breasts where her rapists had branded her with cigarettes. \nShe had no idea where her family was. The NGO said their attempts to track them down had failed.\nI spent more than an hour talking to her.\nIt made me sick just to hear what she had been through, about the brutality human beings can be capable of.\nI was traumatised and, for the first time in my life, I felt fear. And I projected my fears onto two women closest to me - my sister and my best friend, who was also a BBC colleague, two very independent and feisty women.\nEvery time they would visit me, I would insist as they left that they messaged me once they reached home.\nThey humoured me initially, sometimes they would get irritated because if they forgot, I\'d call them in the morning and harangue them. Sometimes they made fun of me.\nAnd then 16 December 2012 happened. \nAs the Indian press gave out gory details of the brutal assault, the trauma was brought alive for a horrified nation.\nFor a fortnight, as Nirbhaya lay in her hospital bed fighting for life, television channels and newspapers reported every little detail of what had been done to her.\nMy sister and my friend no longer made fun of me.\nBut that was not the only change. Giving in to the demands of protesters who took to the streets across India, the government brought in a tougher new law to deal with crimes against women.\nBut the biggest change has been the one in attitudes - sexual attacks and rapes have become topics of living room conversations and that is a huge deal in a country where sex and sex crimes are a taboo, something to be brushed under the carpet, not discussed at length.\nTaking control of the conversation is the first step to India becoming a better place for women. And this conversation has spilt on to social media and India is in the grip of, to borrow a phrase from Nobel laureate VS Naipaul, a \"million mutinies now\". \nEvery incident, big or small, is being discussed and written about, and women\'s rights to safe living and equality have been under much greater scrutiny. In recent years, we\'ve written about many of these campaigns:\nIt\'s not that women were not speaking out earlier - we\'ve had warriors who\'ve been fighting for decades, challenging every thought and idea rooted in patriarchy.\nOver the next few days, we\'ll be bringing you stories of some of these women who have relentlessly campaigned for a better, safer and more inclusive world for themselves and others.\nThe question is: have they been successful? \nRecently released National Crime Records Bureau statistics for the year 2016 paint a dismal picture - crimes against women continue to rise. \nWe still have thousands of brides murdered for dowry, tens of thousands of women and girls raped, hundreds of thousands of incidents of domestic violence and female foetuses being aborted.\nIn the past week alone, we have reported on the brutal rape, torture and murder of a six-year-old, the gang rape of a 16-year-old cancer survivor and a Bollywood actress who was sexually harassed by a fellow passenger on a flight.\nBut what is heartening is the refusal of women to give up their fight.

(31, 'Ethical hacking: The challenges facing India', '\nA bug discovered in a government health portal last year left data of nearly two million Indian patients unguarded. The recovery has highlighted the need to encourage ethical hacking in a country which is digitising its infrastructure rapidly, writes Nilesh Christopher.   \nOne year ago, India\'s state-run health portal - which allows users to book online appointments at government hospitals - left exposed a part of its website. \nThis meant that the personal details and health information of nearly two million users could have leaked. \nSecurity researcher Avinash Jain discovered the vulnerability in the Online Registration System (ORS) in August 2018. \nHe was able to access details such as the patient\'s full name, address, age, mobile number, history of appointments made via the portal, patient ID, partial Aadhaar number (a unique biometric identification number) and details of diseases ailing an individual. \n\"The bug would have allowed any attacker to access details of patients who had booked an appointment in any of the 237 registered [government] hospitals,\" said Mr Jain.\nAt the time, he reported the vulnerability to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) and the flaw in the government portal was patched in October last year. CERT-In is an office within the ministry of electronics and information technology which deals with cyber security threats.\nThis correspondent has seen the email correspondence between the researcher and CERT-In from last year. \nAccording to Mr Jain, the incident highlighted the need to encourage ethical hacking in India. \nIn 2015, the country launched the ORS health portal as an easy way for users to book online appointments and skip long queues at government hospitals. \nAny Indian user could book an appointment on the portal by using their biometric identification number. \nIt was a simple vulnerability where by tampering with the patient ID linked to a specific user on the portal, Mr Jain was able to gain access to medical and personal data of several others registered on ORS. \n\"The bug allowed attackers to not only access a patient\'s appointment details, but also cancel appointments set up at specific hospitals,\" Mr Jain said. \nTo check the severity of the bug, he picked India\'s largest government hospital - the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi - to see if he could fish out details of patients. \nHe found more than 18,000 patient details belonging to the premier hospital and \"was able to access the details of appointments made at any given date and time since the service was launched\". \nThis correspondent could not independently verify if the bug was exploited and if any data was stolen in the three years between 2015 and 2018, when the vulnerability was finally fixed. \n\"Stolen medical patient records are sold at 10 times the value of credit card information on the dark web,\" said Rajesh Maurya, a cyber security analyst. \n\"This stolen patient information is usually sold by individuals to those who use it to submit false insurance claims, prescribe restricted drugs, get their hands on someone else\'s prescription or to sell as a patient profile on the dark web to get medical services,\" Mr Maurya added.\nThe global healthcare industry, which manages critical patient data, has often been a prime target for cybercriminals. \nLast year, the Singapore government was subject to a high-profile breach that ended up exposing health information of 1.5 million people. The UK\'s public healthcare provider the National Health Service (NHS) had a data breach last year that affected more than 150,000 patients.   \nWhile there are hackers who exploit bugs and gain illegal access to data, Mr Jain says ethical hackers like him who responsibly disclose critical bugs are not always appreciated. \n\"The Indian government doesn\'t appreciate skilled bug hunters - despite the fact that we help to make data more secure,\" he added. \nA common feature at hacker conferences in India is the discussion of the legal risks of disclosing vulnerabilities - especially when the bug is related to government agencies.\n\"Leaks of vulnerabilities have prompted government agencies to issue notices and in some case, even register complaints against researchers. The risk of legal repercussions always exists,\" Apar Gupta of Internet Freedom Foundation, a non-profit watchdog, said. \nAs India seeks to digitise a large part of its infrastructure and make government services available online for several of its e-governance initiatives, the risk of cyber-attacks on portals which host sensitive user information increases. \nAs per information reported to and tracked by CERT-In, more than 300,000 cyber-security incidents were reported in 2019 - a steep increase from a 50,362 incidents in 2016. \nThis is where security researchers or ethical hackers become increasingly important because they can help protect against possible attacks and access flaws in the digital infrastructure. \nSrinivas Kodali, a security researcher who has exposed flaws in the Unique Identification Authority of India, says the relationship between the Indian government and researchers \"is complicated\". \n\"They [government] always fix the issue if it is a critical bug. But they may or may not let you know about it. Sometimes they are thankful and sometimes they complain about your meddling in their affairs,\" he said. \nWhat many researchers, including Mr Jain, want is for their efforts to be acknowledged and possibly have a \"hall of fame\" list online of all the researchers who have responsibly disclosed flaws in the digital assets of the government. \nIndia ranks as the top hacker location globally, where Indian \'white hat hackers\' or bug bounty hunters made $2.3m (£1.7m) discovering bugs in 2019. \nCompanies pay \'white hat hackers\' to hack their websites to find weaknesses in their security systems. Bounty hunters earn rewards for reporting vulnerabilities in international software companies where the culture of responsible bug disclosure is encouraged. \nBut India currently does not have any law that protects security researchers who responsibly disclose bugs. \nThe Indian Information Technology Act clearly states that any individual who gains unauthorised access to a computer resource is guilty or liable. Since the crime is defined in the context of unauthorised access, many researchers fear retribution from authorities, which prevents them from reporting flaws. \nWith no well-established protocol at the federal or state level to deal with vulnerability reporting, it often carries an element of risk. \n\"This can be addressed by making legal amendments to the law. Further, operating practices and policy framework can also be developed to close such vulnerabilities by a progressive bug bounty programme,\" Mr Gupta said. \nNilesh Christopher is a Bangalore-based technology writer', ' Nilesh Christopher Avinash Jain Online Registration System Indian Computer Emergency Response Team Jain Medical Sciences Delhi Rajesh Maurya Maurya Apar Gupta Freedom Foundation Srinivas Gupta Nilesh', '4 12 2019'),
(32, 'Why India\'s financial system is vulnerable to hacks', '\nA recent cyber-attack on a nuclear power plant has sparked a debate on the country\'s ability to protect itself in a cyber-war. But experts say Indians should be more worried about the vulnerability of its financial systems. The BBC\'s Ayeshea Perera finds out more.\nNews that India\'s biggest nuclear plant - the Kudankulam facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu - had been subject to a cyber-attack made headlines across the country last month. \nIt sparked conversations about whether the country was \"cyber-ready\" and many questioned whether it would be able defend critical infrastructure from malicious digital attacks. \nBut there is a much bigger issue that affects millions of Indians - debit card hacks and other forms of financial fraud. \nJust last month, India\'s central bank asked banks to investigate a warning by the Singapore-based cyber-security firm Group-IB that the details of 1.2m debit cards were available online.\nAnd last year hackers were able to siphon off 900m rupees ($12m; £9.7m) from Cosmos bank in the western city of Pune through a malware attack on one of its data suppliers.\n\"India\'s financial systems are extremely vulnerable, because we still rely on international banking networks like Swift to make transactions. International gateways are open vectors of attack for India,\" Arun Sukumar, head of the cyber initiative at the Observer Research Foundation think tank, told the BBC. \nAnd a report by cyber-security company Symantec said India was among the top three countries in the world for phishing and malware attacks. \nAlthough this comes down to the sheer size of India\'s digital population - the population of France is added every month to the country\'s internet - it is a big concern because many first-time internet users are being pushed to use digital payments.\nIn November 2016, for instance, when the government suddenly removed 80% of the country\'s cash from the economy by saying that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid, Prime Minister Narendra Modi heavily promoted digital payments as an alternative. \nMobile payment platforms - both indigenous (Paytm) and international (Google) - have since become a massive industry in India. A report by Credit-Suisse estimated that mobile payments in India would become a $1tn market by 2023. Credit and debit card payments are also popular, with an estimated 900m cards operational in India today.\n\"Many of the newest entrants to India\'s internet - more than half the 600 million-odd total users - are from the middle or bottom of the pyramid. This means that very often, their digital literacy is low, or they are migrant labourers working in states where they are not familiar with the language. So they are very vulnerable to fraud,\" technology expert Prasanto Roy told the BBC.\n\"And secondly, there is inadequate reporting of fraud by banks, which means sometimes consumers are not even aware of what has happened.\"\nFinancial fraud in India takes many different forms. Some involve hackers fixing skimmers and keyboard cameras to ATMs, which duplicate the card details of unsuspecting users. Others involve calling people up and tricking them into handing over information.\n\"The problem is that in a digital transaction lines are blurred and confusing. In the real world there is a clear distinction between giving and receiving. But on a mobile payment platform, this is not always clear. For instance, someone trying to sell a table online might be called by someone posing as a prospective buyer, offering to make an online payment,\" Mr Roy explained.\n\"If that person says that he or she has made a payment and tells you that you will get a code via text message to confirm the transaction, many users would think nothing of it, even if they are asked to tell that person the code. The next thing they know is that the money has been deducted from their account.\"\nOne problem is that the systems themselves are not secure or transparent enough. In the Cosmos fraud for instance, the software was not able to throw up red flags when so many transactions were compromised. And by the time the fraud was discovered, a huge sum of money had been lost. \nFurthermore, a lack of standardisation also makes transactions confusing, especially for first-time users. ATMs for instance, come in many different forms and each payment app in the country has a different interface. \nSecondly, Mr Sukumar points out that there is also a human problem. People lack even basic awareness of the dangers, leaving both themselves and sometimes entire systems at risk. \nHe made a comparison with the 2010 malware attack on an Iranian nuclear plant: \"After all, the Stuxnet attack was made possible by an errant staff member who reportedly plugged an infected USB drive into one of the computers at the Natanz nuclear plant.\" \nMr Roy says it is for the government and institutions to provide security in financial transactions - not the end user. \n\"Given the rate of India\'s internet growth, it is not possible to rely on just education alone. It\'s not possible for everyone to keep up with the sophisticated methods of hackers, especially when they are constantly changing tactics and methods. So the onus has to be on regulators and payment firms to protect users,\" he said.\nThe other problem is that communication between the various cyber-security organisations is just not fast enough. \nThe Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert), who are the frontline defenders of India\'s digital infrastructure, are sometimes too slow to respond to reported threats.\nBut India is already aware of this. The country is formulating a national cyber-security policy for 2020 and officials have identified six critical areas where policy needs to be where special attention is needed. Finance security is one of these areas. \nIdeally, says Mr Roy, the Certs being planned for the six critical areas should communicate with each other, with oversight from a coordinator.\nIt is only then that India will be able to effectively respond to the risks that come with moving to a largely cashless economy.', ' Ayeshea Perera Tamil Nadu Arun Sukumar Symantec Narendra Modi Natanz Certs', '15 11 2019');

He is seeking a new hearing with a \"fair and impartial judge\". \nBoth men were on hunger strike until last week protesting against their detentions and demanding to be freed while their cases were being decided by immigration judges. Immigration officials in the US have the power to detain or release single adult asylum seekers while their cases are being heard. \nThe two men are among more than 9,000 Indians apprehended by the US Border Patrol in 2018, nearly three times as many as in 2017. A substantial number of them are from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana. Some are from the western state of Gujarat.  \nIn July, border patrol agents found the body of a six-year-old Indian girl in a remote desert in Arizona - she had died trying to cross with a group of people into the US. \nThe majority of Indians are asylum seekers, but rejections are high. More than 7,000 Indians were returned from the US between 2015 and 2017, according to homeland security. \nMany of them have \"said repeatedly that they feel El Paso area Immigration and Customs Officials [ICE] officials discriminate against them in detention, an accusation officials have denied\", according to Robert Moore, a former editor of El Paso Times who has been tracking the cases closely.\nA month after Mr Kumar and Mr Singh began their hunger strike, a court ordered that the two men be force-fed to keep them alive. \n\"The nurse took out a long tube, and the doctor said, \'Eat or we will insert this in your nose. I refused and they started inserting the tube again… They repeated this three times until my nose was swollen,\" Mr Kumar said in a deposition to the court. \nMr Singh lost 17kg (37lb) in detention, and says being force-fed was painful and humiliating. \n\"My client describes this process as torture. This was done while other hunger strikers were made to watch, and so it was also humiliating.  The tube was left in for several weeks, causing discomfort and pain.  My client was unable to sleep for several weeks due to the pain from the tube, but also from his hunger strike,\" Jessica Miles, Mr Singh\'s lawyer, told me.\n\"I have represented hunger strikers before, and I was shocked at Mr. Singh\'s condition and very concerned that he would die of cardiac arrest, as were doctors that I consulted with about his condition.\"\nLawyers say force-feeding causes severe nosebleeds and vomiting, while the UN has warned it could amount to torture, and is medically unethical. Immigration officials say force-feeding is carried out for the migrants\' own health and safety. Going without food for long periods of time can leave people at risk of long-term physical and mental health conditions.\nAjay Kumar says he came from a farming family in Haryana, and was involved with an opposition party in the state, which is governed by the Hindu nationalist BJP. \n\"He says his sister was the victim of an acid attack by political rivals, and his father was murdered [in India] when he was under detention in the US,\" Linda Corchado, Mr Kumar\'s attorney, told me.\n\"It is difficult to bring corroborative evidence to prove your claims when you are under detention.\"\nMr Singh, who comes from Punjab, has told his lawyer that he was \"involved with a political party, beaten several times because of his political activities, and threatened with death if he did not join the opposition party\". \nIt is not clear how many Indians are in detention centres in El Paso, but attorneys visiting the area in February found there were more than 200 detained men with Indian last names. \n\"The main issues facing asylum seekers in detention are lack of language access, denial of religious accommodations, medical neglect, solitary confinement, force-feeding, denial of bond or parole, and prolonged or indefinite detention rather than processing of asylum claims,\" Lakshmi Sridaran of New York-based South Asian Americans Leading Together group, told me.\nHunger strikes are also becoming increasingly common, say immigration lawyers in El Paso.\nLawyers and activists say 13 Indian men held at the border were refusing food and were being force-fed in El Paso alone this year, sparking a controversy over the medical ethics of the exercise. \n\"Hunger strikes are becoming increasingly common as people are detained by default with no possibility of release,\" Margaret Brown Vega, a volunteer co-ordinator with the group Advocate Visitors with Immigrants in Detention, told me.\nIn the past, illegal immigrants from Cuba, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Venezuela and Nicaragua have gone on hunger strikes in detention centres. They have usually lasted less than a couple of weeks. Indian detainees seem to have gone on hunger strikes for the longest periods of time.  \nIn April, two Indian men who were force-fed during another hunger strike lasting 74 days were freed after eight months at an El Paso detention centre. \"Their protest drew international attention, particularly after federal judges authorised ICE to force-feed the detainees through a feeding tube,\" Mr Moore reported. \nJasvir Singh, 22, and Rajandeep Singh, 23, described force-fed three times a day as \"painful and dehumanising\".\nAfter they are medically cleared and freed, Ajay Kumar and Gurjant Singh will be living with local sponsors in El Paso.  Their movements will be restricted and they will be fitted with ankle monitors or electronic monitoring devices so the authorities know where they are.\n\"They are welcome to stay as long as they like. We\'ve found a doctor outside who has volunteered to check on them while they recover in the weeks to come,\" one of the sponsors told me. \"I am fully confident that these fine young men will, through their actions, demonstrate that their detention was totally unnecessary to begin with\".\n\"Ajay is focussed on his appeal and feeling better. But he\'s anxious and feeling a lot of trauma,\" said Ms Cochado. \n\"He is terrified of being returned to India.\"\nRead more from Soutik Biswas\nFollow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC', ' Ajay Gurjant Singh Kumar Punjab Haryana Gujarat El Paso Customs Officials Robert Moore Singh Kumar Singh Jessica Miles Singh Mr. Singh Ajay Kumar Haryana Hindu Linda Corchado Kumar Singh Punjab Lakshmi Sridaran New Margaret Brown Vega Venezuela Nicaragua Moore Jasvir Rajandeep Singh Ajay Kumar Gurjant Singh Ajay Read Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik Twitter', '26 9 2019'),

A few of her guards are also seen shooting along with her.\nIndian media reports quoted stunned guests at the wedding as saying that the Sadhvi, which is the Hindi word for holy woman or god woman, walked up to the dance floor, asked the DJ to play a song of her choice, and began dancing. \nAnd, much to the horror of everyone around, shooting. \nWhy attending an Indian wedding can be dangerous \nRadhe Ma: Why is India\'s \'godwoman\' in the news?\nReports said families of both the bride and the groom pleaded with her to stop, but their entreaties fell on deaf ears.\nIt was only when the groom\'s 50-year-old aunt collapsed after being hit by a stray bullet and three others were critically injured, that the firing stopped. \nIn the confusion that followed, the Sadhvi and her six guards escaped. \nPolice registered a case of murder against the seven and, on Friday, the Sadhvi surrendered in a magistrate\'s court.

To control this, the government should bring in a law to stop Muslims and Christians from producing so many children. They should be forced to undergo sterilisation so that they can\'t increase their numbers,\" she told a gathering.\nThe Sadhvi said she agreed with some Hindu nationalist leaders\' suggestion that Hindu women must have more children to counter the threat of becoming a minority religion in their own country.\n\"How do you compete with a line that keeps getting longer? You draw a line next to it that\'s even longer,\" she said.\nIn another controversial remark, the DNA newspaper quoted her as saying that idols of Hindu gods and goddesses should be placed in mosques and churches and that a statue of Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, should be installed in Haryana.\nThe Sadhvi was born and grew up in Bras, a small village in Karnal district, and a few years ago set up an ashram in her village. She has a small following and most of her followers are local villagers.\nA local journalist says she is a known publicity-seeker with a fancy lifestyle.\nThe 27-year-old is always dressed in saffron robes from head to toe.

A white band on her left wrist describes her as \"unknown female\".  \nA full-term healthy baby, her tiny face is perfectly formed and it is impossible to not fall in love with her. \"She is beautiful,\" I say. \nVeena Bahri, the head nurse, laughs: \"Everyone says that.\" \nAs we stand there chatting, the baby begins to bawl. She is hungry. A nurse picks her up, comforts her. She brings out a small steel cup with a long beak, fills it with milk and starts to feed her. The crying stops instantly. \nWith her belly full, she is calm again. Once she is put down on the bed, she rolls her left hand into a fist and sucks on her fingers. A few minutes later, she yawns. \"She\'s going to sleep now,\" says Dr Jeeva Sankar.\nWhile all the other babies in the nursery are being lovingly held by their parents, this one lies alone. \nShe came into the world \"unwanted\" and stares at an uncertain future.\n\"We received an anonymous call just after 01:00 informing us that a baby was lying on the pavement in Munirka district of south Delhi. The person who called us had been alerted by the baby\'s crying,\" police official Somnath Paruthi told the BBC. \nWhen police reached the spot, they found the infant inside a plastic bag, without any clothes, distressed and crying. \nThe winter season is just kicking off in Delhi and in the past couple of weeks, the night temperatures have dipped.\nTo keep the baby warm, a woman constable wrapped her up in a piece of cloth and they rushed her to the hospital.\n\"When she arrived, she was somewhat cold and her blood sugar was low,\" said Dr Vinod Kumar Paul, who heads the neo-natal department at AIIMS.\nHer medical file suggests she is now perfectly healthy. There were no signs of any external injury or abuse.\n\"We have given her all the mandatory vaccines and since we know nothing about her history, we are testing her for any infections or birth defects,\" Dr Paul says, adding that he expects to find nothing wrong with her.\n\"The baby\'s fine, she\'s happy, she\'s eating well, smiling.\"\nIn the next few days, when all her test results are in, the hospital would declare her fit to be discharged, Dr Paul said. \nShe would then be produced before a child welfare committee of the state government which would place her in the care of an accredited welfare home.  \nThe committee would also order the police to try and track down her parents within a fixed time and if the parents are not found, the baby would be put up for adoption. \nAfter her story was published in Indian newspapers, Mr Purathi says he has received at least two dozen phone calls from people wanting to adopt the baby or send her money.\nHe says they have registered a case \"against unknown persons\" and are trying to track down the parents. \n\"We are trying to find out from the maternity homes in the area about deliveries of baby girls,\" Mr Paruthi said.\nIt appears to be a case of abandonment, he says, adding that the parents may have other girls and may not want another daughter.\nAcross India, there has been a traditional preference for sons over daughters fuelled by a widely-held belief that a male child would carry forward the family name and look after the parents when they grow old while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes.\nThis anti-girl bias has made female foeticide and infanticide rampant in India and it has led to a dangerously skewed sex ratio.\nAccording to the 2011 Census, for every 1000 boys born in India, only 927 girls were born. The latest figures released at the beginning of the year show it has fallen further to 918. \nCampaigners called it \"genocide\", saying millions of female foetuses had been aborted in recent years.\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described it as a \"national shame\" and called for a \"crusade\" to save girl babies and soon after taking over in the summer of 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to Indians to stop killing their daughters. \nSince then, he has repeated that call often - and last year, he launched a scheme asking people to save their daughters and educate them.\nThe messages, however, seem to be having little impact on their intended audiences. \nMr Purathi is angry: \"Recently when a young woman won an Olympic medal, Indians celebrated. And now we find a baby girl being dumped on the pavement to die. We are people with such double standards.\" \nThe police, he says, have named the baby Swadha which means a \"gift of God\".\nDr Paul says every year, about four to six abandoned baby girls are brought into the AIIMS. I ask him if he feels upset when this happens.\n\"Yes, I do feel upset. It\'s not done, leaving a child to nature and elements. But it\'s God\'s wish. And we have to do our duty,\" he says. \n\"But then, it\'s also rewarding. She was left to die.

Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities.\nAbhinandan Singh, senior police officer in Bareilly district where the girl was found, told the BBC he suspected the parents\' involvement in her burial because \"even after the case has been widely publicised, no-one has come forward to claim her\". \nThe newborn was found accidentally on Thursday by a villager who was burying his own daughter, who was stillborn. Hindus generally cremate their dead, but babies and young children are often buried.\n\"When they had dug about 3ft [90cm] below the ground, their shovel hit the earthen pot which broke and they could hear a baby crying. When they pulled out the pot, they found a baby in it,\" Mr Singh said.\nThe baby was taken to the local government hospital and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\"I think she was about a week old when she was brought into the hospital,\" chief paediatrician Dr Saurabh Anjan told the BBC over the phone from Bareilly.\n\"She was a premature baby, possibly born at 30 weeks, and weighed a mere 1.1kg [2.4lb] which is a very low birth weight.\"\nDr Anjan said she had also been hypothermic (her body temperature was 35C, well below the normal 36.5C) and had hypoglycaemia (her blood sugar level was 35 when it should have been at least 45).\n\"She was tiny and very weak, we immediately put her on oxygen and began treating her for hypothermia.\"\nThe baby was moved to Dr Ravi Khanna\'s paediatric hospital on Sunday, because it has better facilities.\n\"She is being kept in the intensive care unit and is being fed fluids through a tube. Her condition is critical. Her platelet count has dropped to 10,000 while the normal range is 150,000 to 450,000, so we are concerned about the infection in her blood,\" Dr Khanna told the BBC on Tuesday. \nThere are differing estimates on how long the baby lay buried under ground and the doctors say they can only guess how she survived.\nDr Khanna said she might have been buried as long as \"three to four days\". \n\"She survived on her brown fat. Babies are born with fat on their abdomen, thigh and cheek and they can survive on it in an emergency for some time. Once she exhausted that, she shrivelled up - as you can see in her photograph,\" he said.\nBut Dr Anjan gives a far more conservative estimate. He believes she was only buried for \"two to three hours\" and might have survived for \"another hour or two\" if she hadn\'t been rescued. \nHe says there would have been an air pocket inside the pot which would have provided her with oxygen. Also, it\'s possible some oxygen may have filtered through the loose soil, while the fact the pot was not made of dense clay could have helped as well.\nLocal state politician Rajesh Kumar Mishra, from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), says he has \"adopted\" the baby and that once she is better, she will be raised by him and his wife in their home.\n\"It\'s a miracle that she survived, I believe that god has saved her life and sent her to me. Now it\'s our duty to do everything for her. She is oscillating between life and death. Once she recovers, I will take her home and raise her as my daughter,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Mishra has named her Sita after a Hindu goddess who, according to the popular mythological text Ramayana, was found by King Janak when he was ploughing a field.\n\"I visit the hospital several times a day to check on the baby. This afternoon when I visited her along with my wife, I called out her name and she opened her eyes, stretched, and looked at me,\" he said.\nThe baby girl\'s abandonment is under investigation and police say they suspect her parents could be complicit in the burial.\nAbandonment and murder of baby girls in India is not uncommon - there has been a traditional preference for sons over daughters, fuelled by a widely-held belief that a boy will carry forward the family name and look after his parents in their old age, while daughters cost families dowries and marry to live with the husband.\nAlthough most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed after birth are not uncommon either. This has also led to a dangerously skewed sex ratio in the country.\nMr Mishra says: \"I don\'t know what was the compulsion of her biological parents that they abandoned her and buried her, all I can say is that what they did was not right. \n\"I\'m praying for her health and long life.

(38, 'How Britain\'s opium trade impoverished Indians', '\nIn Amitav Ghosh\'s acclaimed novel, Sea of Poppies, a village woman from an opium-producing region in India has a vivid encounter with a poppy seed. \n\"She looked at the seed as if she has never seen one before, and suddenly she knew that it was not the planet above that governed her life; it was this miniscule orb - at once beautiful and all - devouring, merciful and destructive, sustaining and vengeful.\"\nAt the time when the novel is set, poppy was harvested by some 1.3 million peasant households in northern India. The cash crop occupied between a quarter and half of a peasant\'s holding. By the end of the 19th Century poppy farming had an impact on the lives of some 10 million people in what is now the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. A few thousand workers - in two opium factories located on the Ganges river - dried and mixed the milky fluid from the seed, made it into cakes and packed the opium balls in wooden chests. \nThe trade was run by the East India Company, the powerful multinational corporation established for trading with a royal charter that granted it a monopoly over business with Asia. This state-run trade was achieved largely through two wars, which forced China to open its doors to British Indian opium. \nHistorian William Dalrymple, author of The Anarchy, a new book on the East India Company, says it \"ferried opium to China, fighting the opium wars in order to seize an offshore base at Hong Kong and safeguard its profitable monopoly in narcotics\". \nSome historians have argued that the opium business bolstered India\'s rural economy and kept the farmers happy. That was not the case, as new research by Rolf Bauer, a professor of economic and social history at the University of Vienna, has found. \nFor years Dr Bauer trawled through archival documents looking at the costs of producing opium and paying money to farmers. \nHe also examined an exhaustive history of the trade - the 1895 Report of the Royal Commission of Opium, which ran into seven volumes and 2,500 pages. \nIt contained 28,000 questions and hundreds of witness reports on the use and consumption of opium in India, and studied how the colonial government regulated its production and consumption. \nThe result of the research is published in Dr Bauer\'s new study of the trade, The Peasant Production of Opium in Nineteenth-Century India. His conclusion: the opium business was hugely exploitative and ended up impoverishing Indian peasants. \"Poppy was cultivated against a substantial loss. These peasants would have been much better without it,\" Dr Bauer told me.\nThis is how the East Indian Company ran the trade. Some 2,500 clerks working in 100 offices of a powerful colonial institution called the Opium Agency monitored poppy farmers, enforced contracts and quality with police-like authority. Indians workers were given commissions on every seer - a traditional unit of mass and volume used in large parts of Asia - of opium delivered on their beat.  \nIn the thriving, state-run global trade, exports increased from 4,000 chests per year at the beginning of the 19th Century to more than 60,000 chests by the 1880s. Opium, says Dr Bauer, was for the large part of the 19th Century, the second-most important source of revenue for the colonial state. It was only outmatched by land taxes. (India remains the world\'s biggest producer of legal opium for the global pharmaceutical market.)\n\"The government\'s opium industry was one of the largest enterprises on the subcontinent, producing a few thousand tons of the drug every year - a similar output to Afghanistan\'s notorious opium industry today, which supplies the global market for heroin,\" Dr Bauer says.\nMore importantly, the crop, he adds, had a \"lasting negative impact on the lives of millions\". \nInterest-free advance payments were offered to poppy farmers who could not access easy credit. By itself, this was not a bad thing for those producing for the global market. \nWhat made it bad for them, according to Dr Bauer, was what they paid for rent, manure, irrigation and hired workers was higher than the income from the sale of raw opium. \nIn other words, the price peasants received for their opium did not even cover the cost of growing it. And they were soon trapped in a \"web of contractual obligations from which it was difficult to escape\".\nStiff production targets fixed by the Opium Agency also meant farmers - the typical poppy cultivator was a small peasant - could not decide whether or not to produce opium. They were \"forced to submit part of their land and labour to the colonial government\'s export strategy\". \nLocal landowners forced their landless tenants to grow poppy; and peasants were also kidnapped, arrested and threatened with destruction of crops, criminal prosecution and jail if they refused to grow the crop. \"It was a highly coercive system,\" Dr Bauer says.\nBy 1915 the opium trade with China, the biggest market, had ended. However, the British Indian monopoly on opium continued until India won independence in 1947. What confounds Dr Bauer is \"how a few thousand opium clerks controlled millions of peasants, forcing them to produce a crop that actually harms them\".\nIt\'s a good question.\nRead more from Soutik Biswas\nFollow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC', ' Sea Poppies Uttar Pradesh Bihar Ganges East India Company William Dalrymple East India Company Rolf Bauer Bauer Bauer Bauer Opium Agency Opium Agency Read Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik Twitter', '5 9 2019'),

And crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. At least 300,000 farmers have killed themselves since 1995.\nDaughters, wives and other family members of farmers who took their own lives over crop failure or mounting debt are also participating in the protest - with some of them carrying photographs of their loved ones.\nRead more about India\'s farming crisis\nThe march has been organised by an umbrella group of farmers\' organisations from different parts of the country. Many of the protesters are also members of the farmers\' wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).  \nThey have been arriving in Delhi since Thursday night. They gathered at a huge public ground that is often used for political rallies and spent the night in tents there. They started matching towards the parliament on Friday morning even as thousands of policemen were deployed for security. \nSangita Bhoir, a woman farmer from the western state of Maharashtra, had protested in Mumbai city a few months ago.

In March, tens of thousands of farmers from the western state of Maharashtra had walked 160km (100 miles) to Mumbai city in support of similar demands. \nAnd last year, drought-hit farmers from the southern state of Tamil Nadu brandished human skulls and held live mice in their mouths to draw attention to their plight.', ' Delhi Lakhan Pal Singh Half Read Delhi Sangita Maharashtra Delhi Delhi Monami Basu Delhi University Delhi Maharashtra Tamil Nadu', '30 11 2018'),

We could hear the animals.\" \nMr Lal says it is the \"camaraderie among trackmen\" that helps them get through difficult situations. \"We stay away from our families for days but working in groups ensures that we don\'t become too sad,\" he says.\nRailway officials say the department is fast modernising the way it maintains tracks and installs fresh ones, but the role of the trackmen remains crucial and is unlikely to change.\n\"No matter how modern we become, we cannot replace the trackmen. They are our eyes and ears on the ground. They inspect every inch of our tracks at least once in a day,\" an official says.\nDespite the importance given to their work, the trackmen remain at the bottom of the pay structure - although they receive healthcare and housing, a new trackman earns around 15,000 rupees (£152;$243) a month.\n\"They are on the frontline of the railways\' work and their job is dangerous.

But we realise the importance of the job because millions of lives depend on us.\" \nSome of the trackmen are also deployed to man railway crossings and handle manual signalling on less busy routes. The railway has automated most of its signalling but in some remote areas manual handling still exists.\nI meet Arvind Kumar in one such area near Allahabad and ask him if weather impacts his work. \n\"Whenever it\'s too hot or rains heavily, we have to be extra alert because tracks are more likely to suffer damages during extreme weather conditions,\" he says.\nThe railways, however, have been beset with problems - there have been several train accidents in recent years in which hundreds have died.\n\"We do our best to maintain the tracks, but accidents still happen. But we always hope and pray that passengers are safe.

I don\'t need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won\'t only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I Karan Johar will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me,\" Johar says in the book.\nThe title of his memoir, An Unsuitable Boy, is a play on A Suitable Boy, the novel by award-winning Indian author Vikram Seth.\nSeth has publicly spoken up against a draconian Indian law that criminalises homosexuality. His mother, a former judge and writer, has also written about Seth being gay.\nIn an interview Seth had said that it was a \"sad dereliction of their responsibility\" when famous Indians refused to come out and be \"role models\" for many others who were suffering silently. \nHowever, Johar\'s memoir, co-authored with journalist Poonam Saxena, does not do that.\nAnd Bollywood\'s budding filmmakers, activists and Twitterati have come down on him saying he has only trivialised being gay in his films. They say his decision to hold back from explicitly coming out, and opting to leave \"bold clues\" about his sexuality instead, belittles their suffering. \nIn response to the criticism Johar writes, \"The reason I don\'t say it out aloud is simply that I don\'t want to be dealing with the FIRs [police complaints]. I\'m very sorry. I have a job, I have a commitment to my company, to my people who work for me; there are over a hundred people that I\'m answerable to. \n\"I\'m not going to sit in the courts because of ridiculous, completely bigoted individuals who have no education, no intelligence, who go into some kind of rapture for publicity.\"\nAccording to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\". Last February, the Supreme Court agreed to revisit a previous judgement that upheld the law.\nIn deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate. \nHowever that has not mitigated the outpouring of anger against Johar.\nOne of his strongest critics is Apurva Asrani, a script writer and editor of Aligarh, a gay rights Bollywood film based on true incidents.\nAsrani went on social media to criticise Johar\'s autobiography and his resistance to coming out, saying that he was \"appalled\". He called Johar\'s extract on his sexuality a \"regressive and a cowardly statement\".\nJohar\'s book also details his lonely childhood. He talks about growing up with weight issues in a plush neighbourhood in Mumbai among children of the film industry as his father was a producer. \nThe book also talks about Johar\'s well known friendship with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his spats with Bollywood\'s leading ladies.\nJohar\'s films have been set in locations in America or Britain dealing with the romantic issues of the rich and the beautiful.\nHis films have been criticised for stereotyping women as in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and for peddling fluff.\nThey have often poked fun of gay characters and have used innuendos and jokes while referencing gays in his films.\nHis production house may have backed many meaningful films that have spoken about gay issues with sensitivity, but his own storytelling in his movies and memoir is wanting, say critics.  \nIn addition to his films, Johar also hosts a hugely popular television chat show filled with Bollywood\'s beautiful people discussing their crushes, courting controversies, fuelling gossip and adult jokes.\nIn the show, Johar also allows gay jokes, uses self-mocking throwaway lines about his sexuality and uses innuendo which has irked critics for trivialising his sexuality.\nBut he also has his supporters. \"His book is remarkably candid and courageous.

The biggest cities here were Harappa and Mohenjo Daro, where some 80,000 people are believed to have lived. \nMohenjo Daro - or Mound of the Dead - was one of the world\'s earliest major urban settlements. It is also one of the world\'s largest archaeological excavation sites, located in modern day Sindh province in Pakistan.\nGowariker\'s film is set in 2016 BC. The hero, Sarman played by Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan, is a farmer of indigo textiles.  The heroine, played by south Indian actress Puja Hegde, is a priest\'s daughter.\nThe hero dances and serenades the heroine who wears plumes in her headgear. Wild horses are tamed at the speed of a rodeo show. Characters speak a strangely accented Hindi.\nAn evil king played by Kabir Bedi, throws the hero into a Roman coliseum-like arena in a gladiatorial fight. (Historians say there is no evidence of such practices.) Critics found the actors looked \"more like Aryans\" than the dark skinned Proto-Australoids who possibly inhabited the ancient city.\nThe film\'s epic climax is a devastating flood that submerges the city, with the hero valiantly saving the citizens with a Noah\'s Ark trick to take them to safety across the swollen river. (Theories about the city\'s decline include devastating floods in the Indus Valley, droughts, or an Aryan invasion that led to the inhabitants abandoning the city for the Ganges plains.) \nAll this has not gone down well with critics and historians alike.\n\"Creating fiction in an authentic historical setting is what historical fiction is about, but Bollywood seems to throw the authentic setting to the winds in favour of a better story,\" says Diptakirti Chaudhuri, author of Bolly Book, The Big Book of Hindi Movie Trivia. \n\"And the liberties - while acceptable under the guise of fiction - often make one wonder why link it to a particular historical episode or era at all?\" \nMr Chaudhuri says the film \"had the additional disadvantage of being released in an era of hyper-promotions and people knew the makers had messed up many aspects of accepted history right from the time the first trailer came out\". \nHe\'s right. Social media began criticising the glamourised version of an ancient historical city even as the film\'s trailer was released. \nRuchika Sharma, a student of archaeology in Delhi, tweeted that the heroine\'s glamorous costumes were nothing but \"sick Orientalism\" and condemned \"Bollywood depicting tribal societies in stereotypical terms with feathers in their hair and paint on their faces\".  \nFilm critic Anupama Chopra called the film \"a mess\" and an \"unintentional comedy\". The New York Times said Mohenjo Daro \"isn\'t really interested in how the city worked, or in its ancient bells and whistles\".\nParents who took their school going children to watch Mohenjo Daro have returned disappointed to find more romance that history in the movie.\n\"Movies have a big impact on school students and misrepresenting history can lead to confusion,\" says Vasav Dutta Sarkar, a Delhi-based history teacher.  \nShe points out how the 2001 Bollywood film Asoka, the great Indian warrior king, was \"riddled with historical inaccuracies and many students confused the movie for historical facts\" in classrooms. \nIn her book Reel History: The World According to Movies, British historian Alex von Tunzelmann writes that a \"lot of people can and do believe some of the things they see in the movies\".\n\"Many of us will know that a particularly outlandish claim is tosh when we watch it, but years later it may have taken root in our imaginations - and we don\'t always remember that we first saw it in a fictional film.\" \nNow Mohenjo Daro\'s makers and cast have defended the film as historical fiction. They claim that the film is a fictitious tale of people of a bygone time.\n\"Hindi cinema is entertainment cinema not realist cinema\", says Rachel Dwyer, a professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema of London University\'s School of Oriental and African Studies. \nIn his defence, Gowarikar told an interviewer to \"suspend disbelief\" while watching the film and ignore the history and authenticity part of the film.\nHe also said he had \"taken plenty of artistic liberties with the looks of the characters\". \nGowarikar\'s supporters have also pointed out that Hollywood has also slipped with regard to history with movies like 300, Rise of an Empire or 2000 BC.\n\"Popular history is more important than academic history in films.

He meets people, \"both good and bad\", visits places and learns the language.\nHe painstakingly discovers that many people believe that only god can help him find his remote control.\nHe visits remote temples, mosques and churches. He follows advices given by priests and religious leaders to convince the god of every faith.\nBut Khan\'s character slowly finds out some self-styled gurus or \"godmen\" use superstitions and \"fraud\" to \"cheat\" people.\nPK is not the first movie that has taken a controversial but critical look at religious practices in India.\nBut then why is the film generating strong reactions?\nThe answer lies in the movie\'s simple narrative. It doesn\'t reach any conclusion on the existence of religion, but simply questions superstitions. \nIn one of the scenes, a priest tells a man to take an arduous journey to a temple in the Himalayas to ensure that one of his sick family members gets well.\nPK jumps into the conversation and asks the priest if it\'s true that god considers all humans as his sons and daughters.\nYes, says the priest. \nPK follows up with another question: \"Which father would send an already troubled son on an arduous journey?\".\nSuch simple but important questions have made the movie a thought-provoking drama.\nI remember many moist eyes in the theatre after a particular scene in which PK recounts his efforts in convincing \"the almighty\" to return his remote control.\nThe sequence shows PK bathing in holy rivers, trekking to reach holy temples and painfully beating himself in mourning.\nHe later discovers that such advice doesn\'t mean much and most \"godmen\" use religions to do business and make profits.\nThe rest of the movie is all about PK\'s debate with one such powerful \"godman\" who is in possession of his remote control.\nIn the end, he proves the guru wrong, falls in love with a female journalist who helps him, and returns to his planet.\nThe movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but most have praised Khan and director Rajkumar Hirani for showing courage to take on a deeply sensitive subject.\nFilm analyst Namrata Joshi says the duo deserve credit for bringing such a sensitive topic in a mainstream commercial film.\n\"Aamir is a superstar and that is why this movie has reached millions.

(50, '#MeToo: Why sexual harassment is a reality in Bollywood', '\nEvery year thousands of young men and women head to the western city of Mumbai, India\'s film capital, in search of their own Bollywood dream. But for many the experience becomes a nightmare. The BBC\'s Rajini Vaidyanathan and Pratiksha Ghildial spoke to several actresses who say they have been sexually harassed by directors and casting agents.\nSix years ago, Sujatha (not her real name) persuaded her conservative parents to let her leave her home in a small village in rural India so she could seek her fame and fortune as a Bollywood actress in Mumbai.\nShe was just 19 at the time, with little acting experience and no contacts. But it didn\'t take her long to meet people who were willing to give her advice on how to break into the industry. \nOne of her first offers came from a casting agent who asked Sujatha to meet him at his apartment. She didn\'t think anything of it because she was told it is common for such meetings to happen at home. \nHer account of what happened next is distressing.\n\"He touched me wherever he wanted. He put his hand all over inside my dress. When he started removing it, I froze,\" Sujatha told the BBC. \nWhen she told him to stop, Sujatha says he told her that she didn\'t have the \"right attitude\" for the industry. \nThe BBC has no way of independently verifying Sujatha\'s claims but she told us she has faced unwanted sexual advances on a number of different occasions while seeking acting work.\nShe says that she went to the police on one occasion but her complaint was dismissed by officers who said \"filmy people\" can do what they want.\nSujatha asked us to conceal her identity because she is terrified of speaking out. She believes any actress who does so is accused of being hungry for publicity or after money and, as a consequence, has her reputation trashed. \nBeing asked for sexual favours in return for acting roles is something many people say is prevalent in the Indian film industry. \nBBC News has spoken to around a dozen other young actresses who say they have also faced lurid comments and sexual advances while seeking roles in films. \nThey chose not to reveal their identities because they fear that they would be called liars and face reprisals. \nUsha Jadhav is one of the few women willing to go public with her experiences of harassment. She has been in the business for a decade but she says she still receives unwanted advances, even after she has won a national film award. \nShe hopes that after hearing her story other actresses will come forward and share their stories too.\nWhen she first arrived in Bollywood, she says she was told that she would have to sleep with directors or producers to get ahead. \"We are giving you something - you need to give something back too,\" she recalls being told. \nUsha says some young women in the industry feel they that have no choice but to say yes. She says she has always refused sexual propositions but that has led to threats from some producers, including one who said he would not cast her in his film because she had rebuffed his advances. \n\"He cursed me and said you\'re not going to get any good roles… nothing good will happen to you. And I was like - I don\'t think you have much power.\"\nPower is part of the dynamic which drives many of these encounters, says Radhika Apte, an Indian firm star who spoke to the BBC about sexual harassment in the industry. \nWhile most of Bollywood\'s big names have stayed silent on the issue of harassment and abuse, Radhika is one of the few who has chosen to speak out. \nShe recently starred in the blockbuster film, Padman, which tells the story of one man\'s quest to produce low cost sanitary pads. Both on and off-screen she is a champion for women\'s rights. \n\"I have started talking about it openly… I do understand and empathise with a lot of women in the industry who are scared to talk about these things,\" she says.\nShe says the lack of an entry system in Bollywood makes it easier for this sort of abuse to continue unchecked. \nGetting roles in Indian films is heavily weighted on personal contacts, social conduct and appearance - more so than in Hollywood, where there is a formal process of going through acting schools and the stage, she says.\nRadhika wishes Bollywood could have a #MeToo moment like Hollywood. But, she adds, it won\'t happen until bigger names come forward to support those who are facing abuse.\nOne other well-known actress who has spoken to the BBC about this is Kalki Koechlin, who has in the past talked openly about how she was abused as a child. \nShe says she can empathise with young actresses and actors who are scared to share their own Bollwood horror stories. \n\"People don\'t listen to you if you\'re a nobody,\" she said in a recent BBC interview. \"If you\'re a celebrity and you talk about it...it becomes a headline.\"\nBut the issue of harassment extends well beyond Bollywood. India has thriving film industries in several regional languages and women from those industries are also beginning to speak out.\nRecently an actress from the southern Indian Telugu film industry stripped in public on the premises of a film association to protest against the casting couch. At first she was dismissed as someone trying to seek publicity and was even banned by the local artists association. \nBut the ban was revoked after the National Human Rights Association intervened. Now a sexual harassment committee is being set up in the Telugu film industry to address the issue.\n\"If people in the industry can demand that I send them my nude pictures, why can\'t I strip in public?\" Sri Reddy said in an interview with the BBC. \nThe film industry in the southern state of Kerala recently formed a collective for the welfare of women in that industry after a young actress was allegedly abducted and molested in a moving car.\nSexual harassment is not just restricted to women. \nRanveer Singh, one of Bollywood\'s biggest male actors, said in a 2015 interview that he had experienced the casting couch \"first hand\".\nHe is one of the few men in Bollywood to voice concerns over abuse and harassment. Farhan Aktar, an actor, director and singer, is another male celebrity who has spoken out. \nHe founded MARD, the Men Against Rape and Discrimination campaign, which raises awareness around sexual violence across the country, working in small villages and remote areas too. \nFarhan told the BBC that he would support women in Bollywood speaking out about abuse they say they\'ve faced. \n\"I would trust the women when they say it exists, I completely trust them.\"  \nHe believes Bollywood\'s #Metoo moment is on its way. \"It\'ll only change through women speaking up, some amount of shaming that will put fear into people\'s hearts\".\nBut many of the women the BBC has spoken to believe change won\'t come until there are safe ways for them to report abuse and until more leading figures in the industry accept that there is a problem. \nUntil that time comes, sexual harassment and abuse will remain the one story few in Bollywood want to tell. \nAdditional reporting by Supriya Sobti. \nContact Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter @BBCRajiniV  if you have a story to share.

Stand-up comics like Zakir Khan and Kenny Sebastian, and comedy groups such as All India Bakchod (AIB) and The Viral Fever (TVF), have amassed a few million followers on the video-sharing site. \nBut the arrival of Amazon and Netflix, subscription-based platforms that commission shows and pay for production, offers new possibilities. Uploading a thrifty 10-minute clip on YouTube is no longer the only option for upcoming comedians. \nIf they got their own special on Amazon, they can do an hour-long show and experiment with different styles of humour. \n\"I wanted a grand piano in the backdrop and they made it possible,\" says Aadar Malik, whose comedy special debuted on Amazon Prime Video in early 2017. \n\"These shows have in a way brought us to the same level as Bollywood and cricket,\" says Zakir Khan, equating stand-up comedy with India\'s two most successful sources of entertainment.\nBut, Mr Khan says, when he started doing stand-up comedy in 2011, he never imagined that the profession would \"become this big in India\".\nThe 30-year-old shot to fame after winning Comedy Central\'s competition for India\'s Best Stand Up Comedian in 2012. \nNow, he has his own 90-minute-long comedy special and an eight-episode fictional series on Amazon Prime Video.\nSo, is stand-up comedy on the verge of becoming the next big thing in India?\nSince their launch, both Amazon and Netflix have been aggressively courting young Indian comedians with a large following on social media. \nIn 2017, Netflix released comedy specials featuring Vir Das and Aditi Mittal - two of India\'s earliest and best known comedians. \nMr Das also starred in the Bollywood hit film, Delhi Belly, and has more than 7.5 million Twitter followers. Ms Mittal, who has close to 400,000 Twitter followers, was in the American documentary Stand-Up Planet with Indian-American comedian Hasan Minhaj.\nIn 2017 alone, Amazon Prime Video  launched comedy specials featuring 14 Indian stand-up comics.\n\"Indians love comedy and we picked up that signal from our customers,\" says Vijay Subramaniam, director of content, Amazon Prime Video. \n\"It was made possible by the fact that the country has a growing lead of comedians of different statures, popularity and genres.\"\nSapan Verma, whose comedy special was one of the first to release on Amazon, says this is \"a new career goal for a lot of comedians\".\n\"It has made a perspective shift. Now a stand-up special is what everybody is working towards.\"\nFor many comedians, one of the key benefits of having a show on a global platform is the possibility of reaching audiences in different countries. But with that, Mr Verma says, comes the added pressure to produce a \"kickass product\". \n\"Your special is a representation of you,\" says comedian Neville Shah. \"If you\'re not good in the first 10 minutes, you lose an audience for life.\"\nSumukhi Suresh, whose comedy web series \"Pushpavalli\" released on Amazon in December 2017, believes global streaming services have made the Indian comedy scene more professional and also more demanding.\n\"Earlier, a 10-15 minute show was a big deal,\" says Ms Suresh. \"Now, writing a solid hour-long show is important.\"\nComedian Azeem Banatwalla says the profession has come an \"insanely long way\" - and most Indian stand-up comics would agree that\'s been the case since they first started out.\n\"In the US, comedians take 15-20 years to get their own special,\" Banatwalla says, adding that Indian stand-up comics got such an opportunity within six or seven years.\nAmazon is set to release another season of Indian comedy specials this year.\nThe service also plans to launch its first comedy talent show - Quest for the next stand-up comic - to discover and encourage young stand-up comics in India.\n\"Our customers love what they\'re getting. So there\'s a clear need for us to continue growing in this direction,\" Mr Subramaniam added.\nMs Suresh is currently making a show that will air as part of Amazon Prime\'s second offering of comedy specials in 2018. \n\"The good thing is that since it\'s a second league special, there\'s already a market that\'s been created by the folks last year,\" she says. \"The disadvantage is that the standards are higher.\"\nNetflix too has recently announced that it will release two more live stand-up comedy specials by Vir Das. \n\"We have seen how comedy has become a popular genre in India and this tells us that there\'s a special place for humour among our members in India,\" a Netflix spokesperson told the BBC in an email conversation.\nFor most stand-up comics in India, having their own special is an emotional journey.  \n\"Releasing a five minute YouTube clip is cool but a special is where the audience really gets to know you,\" said Mr Verma. \n\"It has a deeper emotional connect to it and that changes a lot.\"', ' Kanan Gill Gill Netflix Amazon Video Zakir Khan Kenny Sebastian Aadar Malik Amazon Bollywood Zakir Khan Stand Up Amazon Amazon Netflix Netflix Vir Das Aditi Mittal Bollywood Delhi Belly Hasan Minhaj Amazon Video Vijay Subramaniam Amazon Sapan Amazon Neville Shah Sumukhi Amazon Azeem Banatwalla Amazon Subramaniam Amazon Prime Netflix Vir Das Netflix', '24 6 2018'),

They were all also found guilty of other crimes and given smaller terms, but these were to run concurrently. \nAccording to court documents, the young woman had a consensual relationship with Sikri in November 2013 which lasted a month, after which she broke up with him. \nBut for the next 18 months, he used her nude photographs to blackmail her and rape her. Not just that, he also forced her to have sex with his two friends and on one occasion, Sikri and Chhabra gang-raped her.\nThe convicts appealed in the high court and asked to be freed on bail while the case was being heard - and the court agreed. \nIn a country where thousands of people under trial languish in prison for decades, often for minor crimes, it is shocking that men convicted of crimes as serious as gang-rape and blackmail were freed on bail.\nWhat is worse is that the short 12-page court order is littered with statements that have been described by the Indian media as some of the \"worst examples of victim shaming\". \nThe young woman was castigated for drinking beer, smoking, taking drugs, keeping condoms in her room and not confiding in her parents that she was being abused.\nRead the full court order\nIn their order, Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Raj Shekhar Attri said they intended \"to balance the concerns of the victim, demands of the society and law and the element of reformatory and rehabilitative justice\".\n\"It would be a travesty if these young minds are confined to jail for an inordinate long period which would deprive them of their education, opportunity to redeem themselves and be a part of the society as normal beings,\" they added.\nPredictably, the court order has been greeted with howls of protest in India. Many took to social media to express their anger and the victim\'s friends started a petition on change.org condemning the judgement.\nSupreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy told the BBC that the order \"implies she had no right not to be raped\".\nA judgement like this, she says, takes away hard-won victories for women\'s legal equality. \n\"This order seems to be innocent of the legal definition of consent and of the judgements of the Supreme Court that are quite clear that even a woman of \'easy virtue\' may well withhold consent. Any sex after that is rape,\" Ms Nundy says.\nIn a society steeped in patriarchy, it\'s not uncommon for women to be blamed for inviting sexual assault and rape. Victims are often blamed for wearing short skirts or jeans, having boyfriends, being out late at night, or even talking on mobile phones.\nIn fact, until 2003, we even had a law that allowed victim shaming. \nUnder Section 155(4) of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, it was essentially the rape victims who were put on trial and the accused were often allowed to go scot-free if they could prove that \"the victim was of generally immoral character\".\nIn 1980, the Law Commission suggested that the archaic law be amended and in 2000, the Commission recommended its deletion, saying that it could destroy a victim\'s reputation and self-respect.\nDecades later, however, victims continue to be shamed.', ' Geeta Pandey Delhi Punjab Haryana High Court Jindal Global Law School Hardik Sikri Karan Chhabra Vikas Garg Sikri Sikri Chhabra Raj Shekhar Attri Karuna Nundy Nundy Law Commission', '26 9 2017');

(56, 'Why India wants to track WhatsApp messages', '\nIndia\'s plan to mandate the monitoring, interception and tracing of messages on social media has alarmed users and privacy activists - as well as the companies running the platforms. Prasanto K Roy looks at the potential impact of such a move.\nThe country\'s information technology ministry will publish, by January 2020, a new set of rules for intermediaries: platforms that allow people to send, or share, messages. It is a sweeping term, which also includes e-commerce and many other types of apps and websites.\nThe move is in response to an explosion of fake news that has caused mob violence and led to more than 40 deaths in 2017 and 2018. Most frequent were rumours about child kidnappers, circulated on WhatsApp and other platforms. Those messages, with no basis in fact, caused mobs to lynch innocent passers-by. \nSuch \"forwards\" spread to tens of thousands of users in hours, and became nearly impossible to counter once they had spread. \nIn one example in 2018, the victim of mob violence was a man who had been employed by government officials to go around villages with a loudspeaker and tell locals not to believe rumours being spread on social media.\nThere are more than 50 documented cases of mob violence triggered by misinformation spread over social media in India in the last two years. Many platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and Sharechat, a vernacular language social media start-up and app, play a role. \nBut the Facebook-owned WhatsApp is by far the most popular of the platforms. With India accounting for 400 million of its global base of 1.5 billion users, it ends up being the focus of discussions on the spread of misinformation. \nAfter a spate of rumour-driven mob violence in 2018, the government had asked WhatsApp to help halt the spread of \"irresponsible and explosive messages\" on its platform. The platform took several steps, including limiting the number of forwards allowed to five at a time, and putting a \"forwarded\" tag on those messages. \nNot enough, said the government, which now wants WhatsApp to use automated tools to monitor messages, as China does, to take down specific messages. It also wants the company to trace and report the original sender of a message or video. \nIndia\'s attorney general has told the Supreme Court in a related case that social media companies had \"no business to enter the country and carry on if they can\'t decrypt information for investigative agencies, in cases of sedition and pornography, among other crimes\".\n\"See, they [social media companies] have even gone to court to stop us,\" a government official told me off the record. \nHe added that online surveillance in China is far deeper and more sweeping. He is right about that: on its popular WeChat platform, messages famously disappear if they contain banned words.\nWhatsApp says the steps it has taken are working. \nThe labels and limits have reduced the number of forwarded messages on the platform by 25%, a spokesperson said. She added that the company actively bans two million accounts a month for \"engaging in bulk or automated messaging\", and runs a big public education campaign that has reached hundreds of millions of Indians. \nMeanwhile, privacy activists are most worried about the demands to \"trace\" the original sender of a message. \nThe government says it wants to trace messages that cause violence and deaths, but activists fear it will then track down critics, with a chilling effect on free speech. \nThis is no unfounded worry, given the spate of cases where those criticising government actions, such as its crackdown in Kashmir last August, or those writing a letter of protest to the prime minister, end up facing a sedition charge.\n\"What [they want] is not possible today, given the end-to-end encryption we use,\" says Carl Woog, WhatsApp\'s global head of communications, told journalists in Delhi in February. \n\"It would require us to re-architect WhatsApp, leading us to a different product, one that would not be fundamentally private. Imagine if every message you sent was kept with a record of your phone number. That would not be a place for private communications.\"\nSince 2011, India\'s laws have allowed platforms some safe harbour. A phone company cannot be held responsible for what its customers discuss over its phone lines; nor an email provider for the content of emails a person sends to another. \nAs long as the company complies with laws, such as sharing phone records on demand with the authorities, it is safe from legal action. The new proposed rules will make conditions for such safe harbour tougher.\nComplying with the proposed rules would weaken the apps or platforms globally, given the difficulties of maintaining different apps for different countries. \nAnd that\'s not the only problem. The draft rules demand a local India office for any platform which has more than five million users in India. This is ostensibly to find someone to hold accountable when there\'s a problem. \nBut India\'s technology laws define intermediary in a sweeping manner, spanning any platform used to share information. \nSo all of this would end up affecting others too: Wikipedia being an example of a platform that might have to shut down access to Indians, if such a law is enforced. It\'s also not clear what would be done if a messaging platform, such as the increasingly popular Signal or Telegram, did not comply with this rule. \nIt\'s likely that internet service providers would then be directed to shut down access to them.\nWhile privacy activists have taken a hard stance against the contentious provisions - monitoring and traceability - public policy professionals say the government is keener to find a solution than to shut down or seriously disrupt platforms. \n\"They all use WhatsApp: bureaucrats, politicians, cops,\" the India policy head of a global tech company told me. \"No one wants to shut it down. They just need to see WhatsApp taking more serious steps to tackle a real, serious problem.\" \nLike many others, though, he wasn\'t able to spell out what those steps should be.\nPrasanto K Roy (@prasanto) is a technology writer', ' Facebook Sharechat Kashmir Carl Woog Delhi February', '30 10 2019'),

A 17-year-old girl called Meenakshi was also shot and injured.\nCelebratory gunfire isn\'t intended to injure or maim but Raju and Meenakshi were not the only victims that weekend. \nThe father of the groom at another north Indian village shot and injured a 12-year-old boy, while in a third village, a woman was injured as she watched a wedding.\nThen there was the wedding party in the Alipur suburb of the capital, Delhi, earlier in the week. As the wedding celebration was in full swing, one of the guests, a man named Vikas Kumar, pulled out a shotgun and a pistol and started firing.  \nHe loosed two shots into the air and a third at the ground. Two of the groom\'s friends and three members of the wedding band were shot in their legs and feet. All five were admitted to hospital.\nIn February alone, a total of four people were killed in celebratory firing in weddings just in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  \nIn one incident, the groom himself was fatally wounded after one of his guests fired in the air.  \nAmit Rastogi was leading the traditional procession to the bride\'s house on a horse when he was hit in the head.  \nNaturally enough, celebratory gunfire is something the Indian authorities are keen to muzzle.  \n\"Firing with guns and pistols during marriage processions has become a sort of fashion,\" observed a Delhi judge as he handed down a 25-month jail term to a man who fired off a rifle during his friend\'s wedding last year, killing the groom\'s uncle.\n\"It is high time that government tightens the procedure for grant of arms-licence and also evolves a robust mechanism to ensure these licenses are not misused,\" Judge Manoj Jain said.\nMeanwhile, a court in the Uttar Pradesh capital, Lucknow, has ordered that every case of celebratory firing be investigated regardless of whether a case has been lodged with the police.  \n\"Escalation of this trend has to be arrested,\" warned Justice SK Saxena.\nSome families have responded with a no weapons policy at their weddings.\n\"Kind Request: Please Do Not Indulge In Celebratory Firing & Alcoholism,\" read the invitation that went out to the 3,000 guests of Mahirajdhwaj Singh Chandel.  \n\"In the recent times,\" he explained to The Times of India, \"we have witnessed that innocent lives are lost in celebratory firing, and a joyous occasion then simply transforms itself into that of a mourning.\"\nSo what on earth is going on? \nCelebratory gunfire is partly a show of machismo and status, partly an alternative to fireworks, and it is not confined to north India. It is also common in Afghanistan and parts of the Middle East, Balkans and elsewhere.\nMost commonly guns are fired into the air in the mistaken belief that it will avoid injuring anyone. In fact those hit by falling bullets are far more likely to suffer a fatal injury than those in a normal shooting, according to a study by doctors at a Los Angeles hospital.\nThe doctors identified 118 people who had been hit by falling bullets between 1985 and 1992 and found that the death rate was close to one third, compared to between 2% and 6% for those injured in regular shootings.\nThe bullets were travelling more slowly than those fired directly at a person but were more likely to hit victims on the head. \nAccording to the study, a spent bullet falls back to earth at between 90 and 180 metres per second, fast enough to cause a fatal skull injury.\nIn 2003, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the risks following New Year celebrations in Puerto Rico in 2003-04.  It concluded that 19 injuries and one death were caused by falling bullets over a two-day period.\n\"Bullets are not greetings cards - celebrate without weapons,\" was the slogan of a TV and radio campaign in Macedonia in 2005.  \nThe Indian authorities would be wise to undertake a similar campaign.

Ordinary citizens, according to the watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms, are not eligible even if they have firearms licences.\nIn a new report, the watchdog raises some pointed questions.\nWhy should guns be sold only to MPs when many of them already enjoy police protection at state expense?\nWhy are guns being sold to MPs who have \"serious criminal charges\" pending against them?\nWhy are ordinary citizens not eligible to buy these guns?\nDoes the government track the possession of these guns to check if they have been sold off on the black market?\nThe government and the MPs have no answers yet. \nRight to information activist Ambrish Pandey, who unearthed the information, believes the sale of guns to MPs is a result of an \"ad hoc, discretionary and opaque policy of allotment\".\nIndia\'s democracy is already facing a serious challenge from criminalisation of politics.\nNearly a third of MPs - 158 out of 543, to be precise - in the lower house face criminal charges in more than 500 cases. \nSeventy-four of them face very serious charges, such as murder and abduction. \nAnd now we find that the government has freely sold guns to many of them.

(59, 'Radhe Maa: Why is India\'s \'godwoman\' in the news?', '\nIndian \"godwoman\" Radhe Maa has hit headlines in recent weeks after police said they were investigating her in connection with a dowry harassment case and images showing her dressed in a short skirt and dancing to a raunchy Bollywood number surfaced on social media. The BBC\'s Geeta Pandey in Delhi profiles the controversial personality.\nAccording to her followers, Radhe Maa - or mother Radhe - is a reincarnation of the fiery Hindu goddess Durga, has supernatural powers and can perform miracles.\nReports say her religious congregations draw thousands. The attractive 50-year-old is known to dance with her devotees and allows them to lift and carry her. \nShe blesses them by letting them kiss her hand - the more privileged among them can even plant a peck on her cheek. \nAnd red is her favourite colour - she appears at her congregations in bright red and gold saris, bedecked with elaborate gold and diamond jewellery. She carries a golden trident and often sports a glittering crown. \nAccording to her official website though, Radhe Maa comes from humble beginnings. \nBorn in April 1965 in Punjab\'s Gurdaspur district, she was named Sukhwinder Kaur. She lost her mother when she was five and was raised by her father, a Punjab government official.\nWhen she turned 18, she was married off to a man whose family owned a small sweet shop in the village. The couple had two sons and she took up tailoring work to supplement her husband\'s income.\nBut when her husband decided to \"explore business opportunities on foreign shores, leaving his young wife and two children behind\", she was completely dejected.  \nWorried at her state, her father took her to a religious guru who spotted her \"spiritual gifts\" and encouraged her to visit his ashram (commune) and temple as often as she pleased.\nThe site hastens to add however, that she was keen on religion from a young age and while other children played with dolls and toy houses, she hung out in Hindu and Sikh temples.\n\"Even as a child, she was considerate, sensitive, delicate and helpful. Her teachers and friends in those early years remember that she also had the gift of prophesy,\" it says, adding that \"the same teachers and classmates are now her devotees\".\n\"Around the age of 23, she decided that she was no longer a householder and dedicated herself completely to God\", it adds.\nA few years later, she moved to Mumbai, and today has travelled a long way from her humble beginnings.  Today, through her trust, she runs two ashrams (communes) where her gatherings are attended by several hundred people at a time. Apart from all her red and gold finery, she also owns several luxury cars. \nBut in the last few days, her charmed life has begun to unravel and she is increasingly being painted as another charlatan defrauding the gullible by pretending to have direct access to gods and goddesses.\nLast week, the organisers of the one of India\'s biggest Hindu festivals, the Kumbh Mela, barred her from attending the congregation until she was cleared of all charges in a dowry harassment case.  The charges against her have been levelled by a 32-year-old woman who lodged a police complaint in Mumbai alleging that her husband\'s family had harassed her and demanded more dowry from her on Radhe Maa\'s instigation.\nRadhe Maa has denied the charges. She told BBC Hindi\'s Sushant Mohan that she was \"innocent\" and that the allegations were \"false and fabricated\".\nMumbai police, nevertheless, have said they want to question her in connection with the case.\nThen, Bollywood actress Dolly Bindra - a former devotee - lodged a complaint with the police saying she had received threat calls and that she suspected Radhe Maa to be behind them.\nHer image took a further beating after photographs emerged showing her dressed in a red mini skirt and red boots amid reports that she had also been videoed dancing to Bollywood numbers, inviting ridicule on social media. The tag #YoRadheMaaSoRed was the top Twitter trend in India for an entire day with tweets like these:\nWhile critics have accused her of obscenity, her aide Sanjeev Gupta has defended her choice of clothing saying that they were gifts from her devotees in the West and she wore them \"because she didn\'t want to hurt their sentiments\".\nThe explanation, however, has failed to convince her followers and this week, when BBC Hindi\'s Sushant Mohan visited her ashram in Mumbai\'s Borivali district, he found it deserted.\nWith her devotees replaced by a scrum of nosy journalists and police in hot pursuit, what the controversial \"godwoman\" really requires now is some divine intervention to help her get out of the sticky situation she is in.

(60, 'Have no girls been born in 132 villages in India?', '\nWhen reports emerged earlier this week that no girl had been born in 132 villages in the small Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in the last three months, it sparked panic and prompted a government investigation into the matter.\nThe \"no girl villages\" were reported from Uttarkashi, where some 400,000 people live in 550 villages and five towns. Much of the terrain is hilly and remote. In a country which has been grappling with an awful sex-ratio imbalance - largely because of illegal sex-selection abortions - the news has caused considerable anguish.\nExcept that this might not be completely true. \nThe reports said 216 boys and no girls were born in the 132 villages between April and June. But officials found 180 girls and no boys were born during the same period in 129 different villages. And to complete the mixed picture, 88 girls and 78 boys were born in another 166 villages.\nOverall 961 live births were recorded in Uttarkashi between April and June. A total of 479 were girls, while 468 were boys. (The rest were possibly stillborn) This, officials say, corresponds with the district\'s favourable sex ratio of 1,024 women for 1,000 men, higher than the national average of 933 women per 1,000 men.   \nOfficials say the media possibly cherry-picked the birth data provided by volunteer health workers entrusted with collecting it. Some 600 of these workers are tasked with the job of recording pregnancies and births, and carrying out immunisation and birth control programmes. \n\"I feel media reports about the no-girl villages have been misinterpreted. Also, there is not enough understanding of the context. We\'ve ordered an investigation anyway,\" Ashish Chauhan, the senior-most official of the district told me.\nSo 26 officials have fanned out across 82 villages to check the veracity of the data and to find out whether something is wrong. \nWhat could have gone wrong? \nOne possibility is the data is erroneous or incomplete, and the health workers slipped up. Did they assign a number of male births to a group of villages, and a number of female births to another group?\nSecond, Uttarkashi is a thinly populated place. The average population of a village is 500, and some of the more remote villages have a population of about 100. Health officials say the smallest villages will typically have 10-15 households, and a substantial number of such villages with single-sex births \"did not add up to much\".\n\"If girl babies have not been born in so many villages, it would have hurt the overall sex ratio of the district,\" Mr Chauhan said.\nLocals claim there is little history of discrimination between boys and girls in the district, and point to its favourable sex ratio. \"Be it girl or boy, we only pray that the child is healthy and happy,\" Roshni Rawat, a local woman, told the Hindustan Times newspaper. \nAlso, women here are typically more hardworking than men: labouring on farms, cutting grass, milking cows, cooking and doing household chores. Alcoholism among men is high. \nOfficials say they have not reported cases of female foeticide in the district for some years now. There are three registered ultrasound machines in the district, all in government clinics. \n\"There\'s no economies of scale here to carry out large-scale illegal abortions or tests to abort female births,\" says Mr Chauhan.\nBut there\'s an interesting caveat. \nOf the 961 births here between April and June, 207 were recorded at home. (The rest were recorded in hospitals or institutions.) A total of 109 of them were male and 93 were girls, upending the overall sex ratio in this district. \n\"This is a bit of a puzzle. We have to investigate this further. Home births typically happen in far-flung villages where access to ambulances and clinics is difficult,\" Dr Chandan Singh Rawat, a senior medical officer of the district told me. \nIn a week\'s time, we will know more about the so-called \"missing girls\" of Uttarakhand. \nRead more from Soutik Biswas\nFollow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC', ' Uttarkashi Uttarkashi April Ashish Chauhan Uttarkashi Chauhan Roshni Rawat Hindustan Times Chandan Singh Rawat Read Soutik Biswas Follow Soutik Twitter', '25 7 2019'),
(61, 'How Britain tried to \'erase\' India\'s third gender', '\nIn August 1852, a eunuch called Bhoorah was found brutally murdered in northern India\'s Mainpuri district.\nShe lived in what was then the North-West Provinces with two disciples and a male lover, performing and accepting gifts at \"auspicious occasions\" like births of children and at weddings and in public. She had left her lover for another man before she was killed. British judges were convinced that her former lover had killed her in a fit of rage.\nDuring the trial they described eunuchs as cross-dressers, beggars and unnatural prostitutes.\nOne judge said the community was an \"opprobrium upon colonial rule\". Another claimed that their existence was a \"reproach\" to the British government. \nThe reaction was strange considering that a eunuch was the victim of the crime. The killing, according to historian Jessica Hinchy, curiously triggered British \"moral panic about eunuchs\" or hijras as they are called in South Asia. \n\"She was a victim of the crime but her death was interpreted as evidence of criminality and immorality of the eunuchs,\" Dr Hinchy told me. \nBritish officials began considering eunuchs \"ungovernable\". Commentators said they evoked images of \"filth, disease, contagion and contamination\". They were portrayed as people who were \"addicted to sex with men\". Colonial officials said they were not only a danger to \"public morals\", but also a \"threat to colonial political authority\".\nFor nearly a decade, Dr Hinchy, now assistant professor of history at Singapore\'s Nanyang Technological University, trawled the colonial archives on eunuchs that provided unusually detailed insights into the impact of colonial laws on marginalised Indians. The result is Governing Gender and Sexuality in Colonial India, arguably the first in-depth history of eunuchs in colonial India. \nEunuchs often dress up like women and describe themselves as being castrated or born that way. A disciple-based community, it has important roles in many cultures - from sexless people guarding harems to singing and dancing entertainers. \nIn cultures in South Asia, they are thought to have the power to bless or curse fertility. They live with adopted children and male partners. Today, many consider eunuchs transgender, although the term also includes intersex people. In 2014, India\'s Supreme Court officially recognised a third gender - and eunuchs (or hijras) are seen as falling into this category. \nBhoorah was among the 2,500 recorded eunuchs who lived in the North-West Provinces - now India\'s most populous state Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand. \nYears after her murder, the provinces launched a campaign to reduce the number of eunuchs with the objective of gradually causing their \"extinction\". They were considered a \"criminal tribe\" under a controversial 1871 law which targeted caste groups considered to be hereditary criminals.\nThe law armed the police with power of increased surveillance of the community. Police compiled registers of eunuchs with their personal details, often defining \"an eunuch as a criminal and sexually deviant person\". \"Registration was a means of surveillance and also a way to ensure that castration was stamped out and the hijra population was not reproduced,\" says Dr Hinchy. \nEunuchs were not allowed to wear female clothing and jewellery or perform in public and were threatened with fines or thrown into prison if they did not comply. Police would even cut off their long hair and strip them if they wore female clothing and ornaments. They \"experienced police intimidation and coercion, though the patterns of police violence are unclear\", says Dr Hinchy.\nThe community reacted by petitioning for the right to dance and play in public, and perform at fairs. The petitions, says Dr Hinchy, point to the economic devastation caused by the ban on dances and performances. In the mid-1870s, the eunuchs of Ghazipur district complained that they were starving. \nOne of the most shocking moves of the authorities was to take away children who were living with eunuchs to \"rescue them from a life of infamy\". If eunuchs were living with a male child, they risked fines and jail. \nMany of these children were actually disciples. Others appeared to have been orphans, adopted or enslaved as children. There were also children of musicians who performed with eunuchs and appeared to have lived alongside them with their families. Some eunuchs even lived with widows who had children. British officials saw the children as \"agents of contagion and a source of moral danger\".\n\"Colonial anxieties about the threat that hijras posed to Indian boys overstated the actual number of children residing with the community,\" says Dr Hinchy. According to records, there were between 90 and 100 male children found living with registered eunuchs between 1860 and 1880. Very few of them had been emasculated and most of them were living with their biological parents.\n\"The short-term aim of the law included cultural elimination of the eunuchs through erasure of their public presence. The explicit, long-term ambition was limiting, and thus finally extinguishing, the number of eunuchs,\" says Dr Hinchy. \"To many high-ranking colonial officials, the small eunuch community endangered the imperial enterprise and colonial authority.\"\nThe British also began policing other groups which didn\'t fit the binary gender categories - effeminate men who wore female clothing, performed in public and lived in kin-based households, men who performed female roles in theatre and male devotees who dressed as women. \"The law,\" says Dr Hinchy, \"was used to police a diverse range of gender non-confirming people.\"\nIn many ways, the attitudes of the British and the English-speaking Indian elites to eunuchs echo aspects of Hindu faith that colonial rulers found abhorrent. \nIndologist Wendy Doniger has written about the British rejection of the sensual strains of Hinduism as filthy paganism. However, religion was not a factor in the colonial rejection of eunuchs - it was more about \"contamination\", \"filth\", their sexual practices and public presence.\nYet, despite this dark history, eunuchs survived these attempts to eliminate them by evading the police, continuing to have a visible public presence and devising survival strategies.  Dr Hinchy writes that they became skilful at law breaking, evading the police and keeping on the move. They also kept their cultural practices alive within their communities and in private places, which was not illegal. They also became adept at hiding property, so that police could not register it. \nTheir success is clear by the fact that despite being often defined as deviant and disorderly, Dr Hinchy says eunuchs \"remain a visible presence in public space, public culture, activism and politics in South Asia\". \nIn India, they continue to make a living by dancing at weddings and other ceremonies despite facing discrimination and living on the margins. Theirs is a stirring story of resilience and survival.\nRead more from Soutik Biswas', ' Bhoorah Hinchy Singapore Nanyang Technological University Gender Sexuality Colonial India Uttar Pradesh Eunuchs Wendy Doniger Read Soutik Biswas', '31 5 2019'),
(62, 'How Shelley\'s Indian \'disciple\' changed copyright law', '\nIn March 1949, the government in India\'s southern state of Tamil Nadu acquired the work of one of India\'s greatest poets. It was the first time in the world that the state had taken over the copyright of a writer and put  his writings in the public domain. \nSubramania Bharati, who wrote in the Tamil language, was a literary colossus. Influenced by the Romantic poets, the radical poet used the pen-name \"Shelley-dasan\", meaning disciple of Shelly. Much later, inspired by Walt Whitman, he wrote prose poems, possibly for the first time in an Indian language. He was also interested in haiku, the traditional Japanese poetry form. \nBharati was a maverick and remarkably progressive. He was not shy about open demonstration of affection: some of his love poems are addressed to his wife; and a grainy old picture shows the poet with his hand over her shoulder, very unusual for his time. He briefly turned atheist, and his nationalistic writings were banned for sedition by British rulers. \n\"He was the central figure in the making of a modern Tamil culture,\" says historian AR Venkatachalapathy, author of Who Owns That Song, a riveting new book on the battle for Bharati\'s copyright. \nMuch like Scottish poet Robert Burns who died at 37 leaving behind a small debt, Bharati died in poverty in 1921, aged 39, leaving behind his unlettered wife Chellamma and two daughters. By then, the radical poet had written than 700 pages of poetry - Whitman-inspired prose poems; blank verses; and couplets - and more than 600 pages of stories. \nHe was also fairly prolific in his stints as a journalist, writing more than 1,000 pages of articles and editorials. \nThe government paid 5,000 rupees ($73;£55) each to Bharati\'s wife and daughters, and an equal amount to a half-brother of the poet for the copyright. This was a substantial amount of money in 1949. \"It was a revolution in literary history. Since then no famous writer had the honour of their works freed from the claws of copyright before the lapse of the stipulated time period,\" says Dr Venkatachalapathy.\nIf Bharati and his family had held on to the copyright of his works, it would have expired in January 1972 - exactly 60 years after the author\'s death in accordance with the Indian laws. The fact that his copyright was put in the public domain very early on meant that the poet also gained enormous posthumous fame.\nA few million copies of his books have been sold in the past six decades. A 500-page book of Bharati\'s poems can be bought for less than 100 rupees ($1.48;£1.11) today. Tamil movies freely use his songs, making them hugely popular. Bharati, who turned out to be major figure in help fashioning a Tamil identity, has became ubiquitous. \n\"I think it was a fantastic thing for the government to acquire his work and make it accessible and inexpensive. Bharati always wanted his works to be sold freely. His family was paid a generous sum by the government,\" Dr Venkatachalapathy told me. \nBharati\'s works had a tortured afterlife after his death. His wife sold his works to his half-brother for a pittance. The poet\'s songs became popular with the advent of gramophone records and the movies. A powerful movie mogul quickly moved in and bought the poet\'s rights. When a filmmaker used one of his songs in his film, the mogul sued him. \nThis triggered an unusual controversy. Possibly for the first time in the history of literature, a popular agitation demanding the state take over of an author\'s work began. In 1944, Tamil writers demanded that Bharati\'s works needed to be \"rescued from the clutches of private individuals\". Five years later, the government had purchased his works. \"Rather than being a violation of a legal right, this action of the state was intended as an unprecedented honour to the author,\" says Dr Venkatachalapathy. \nBharati is an outlier even in India. A trust held the copyright of Gandhi\'s writings until it lapsed and passed into public domain in 2009. Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi holds the copyright to Nehru\'s work until 2024.  Publishers had free access to Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore\'s works only after 1992.  \nMore than 40 years after Bharati\'s death, his disciple and Tamil poet Bharathidasan\'s writings were also acquired by the government in Chennai.  In 1992, the government bought the copyright to the work of former chief minister and Tamil icon CN Annadurai for more than 7m rupees. \nSince then, the government of Tamil Nadu has acquired the work of more than 100 Tamil writers. \"What was once an unique honour has now been converted into a support scheme for Tamil writers. That is not a very good thing,\" says  Dr Venkatachalapathy. \nBharati himself had railed against the state patronage of arts. \"We must now begin relying on people,\" he wrote in a 1916 essay. \"From now on support and succour for the arts will come from the common people. It is the duty of the artists to instil good taste in them. It will yield them good returns\".', ' Tamil Nadu Tamil Influenced Walt Whitman Who Owns Bharati Robert Burns Bharati Bharati Bharati Bharati Tamil Bharati Venkatachalapathy Bharati Bharati Gandhi Sonia Gandhi Nehru Nobel Rabindranath Tagore Bharati Bharathidasan Chennai Tamil Tamil Nadu Bharati', '31 5 2018'),

If you want 7% growth, we have to improve our railways,\" said G Raghuram, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad city. \nIndia\'s economic expansion has slowed markedly, growing by 4.7% in the 2013-14 financial year and marking the second year of sub-5% growth.\nIndia railways in numbers\nAlready, the new BJP government, backed by a massive mandate, has put up prices. Last month, it hiked passenger fares by 14.2% and freight rates by 6.5% - a move welcomed by economists. \nBut there was a partial rollback on some increases on shorter trips following protests, even though Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government had \"taken a difficult but a correct decision\".\n\"India must decide whether it wants a world class railway or a ramshackle one,\" he added.\nDespite the rise, rail tickets in India remain dirt cheap. \nThis is because freight rates - among the highest in the world - heavily subsidise passenger fares. \nFor the entire overnight ride on the Mewar Express, a ticket can be purchased for as little as 200 rupees ($3; £1.75), making it accessible to poorer passengers who cannot afford to travel by other modes of transport.\nBut the below-cost fares contribute to an annual loss of around $4.5bn (£2.7bn), while the high freight rates mean moving goods by road has become a more viable option.\n\"Indian Railways is kind of schizophrenic in that the machinery cannot decide whether it is working for profit or to please the public,\" said a railways bureaucrat who did not want to be named.\nIn its election manifesto, the BJP has promised to improve the railways\' poor safety record. \nEach day, around 40 people on average are killed somewhere on the vast network. Many die after falling off trains or while crossing tracks. Others are killed in collisions, fires or derailments.\nOver 40% of accidents occurred because of railway staff failure, according to a 2012 government panel report. It also noted that between 2006 and 2011 a rising number of accidents were due to sabotage.\nAnother poll pledge of the BJP is to introduce bullet trains linking India\'s major cities. \nLast week, during a test run between Delhi and Agra, the home of the Taj Mahal, a passenger train clocked 160km (99 miles) an hour, setting a new national speed record. \nThe local media dubbed it a \"semi-bullet\" train because while fast by Indian standards, it only ran at half the speed of a Japanese Shinkansen (bullet train) which travels at 320km (198 miles) an hour.\nMr Modi - the son of a railway platform tea seller - has said he wants a train to run that fast between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, but analysts believe this is unlikely to happen any time soon.\nInstead, they say more \"semi-bullet\" trains could appear as early as 2018 when dedicated freight corridors are expected to open between Delhi and Mumbai in the west, and Punjab state and Calcutta in the east. \nThis will allow existing tracks to be used exclusively by passenger trains that will be able to travel faster than they do today.\nWith a workforce of 1.3 million people, Indian Railways is one of the world\'s largest employers. Many hope Mr Modi\'s government will go the full distance and order a complete restructuring.\nTo improve performance and combat corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, a government report released earlier this year by a committee chaired by Rakesh Mohan, executive director at the International Monetary Fund and former deputy governor of India\'s central bank, called for the \"corporatising\" of Indian Railways by separating its management and operations from the government.\nMr Raghuram from the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad supports the idea; describing it as a \"big ticket item\" he\'d like to see in Tuesday\'s rail budget.\n\"The railway board is extremely inward looking,\" he said. \"There needs to be change in the top management structure.

But frequent accidents have blotted the town\'s image, reports the BBC Hindi\'s Vineet Khare.\nThe 5 September blaze at a fireworks factory that claimed 38 lives was the worst in recent memory.\nIn some of the biggest factory fires, about 40 people died in 2009, 30 in 2001 and more than 60 in 1991. The list of casualties in smaller mishaps is much longer.\nBut more than 700,000 workers of Sivakasi have no other option but to depend on one of the most hazardous industries for their livelihood.\nAbout 20-25 workers die each year in fire accidents in this industry which boasts of an estimated annual turnover of more than $365m (£225m).\nIndia is the second biggest producer of fireworks after China and, manufacturers say, almost all of it is for domestic consumption. \nSivakasi - also known for its matchbox and printing industries - contributes more than 90% to India\'s overall fireworks production.\nBut those who work in the industry carry painful scars - a broken leg or skull, or a hand burnt by explosives, and many here complain of chronic respiratory problems.\n\"In the last 12 months, before this accident, 22 workers lost their lives and 50 were injured,\" says Dr M Kathiresan, chief medical officer at the local government hospital. \nThe hospital has a shortage of staff and equipment and has no supply of morphine, the standard pain relief drug for burn victims.\nAfter a brief shutdown following the 5 September accident, the factories have reopened and the workers are back.\n\"We are scared, but what else do we do,\" said Pummeraj, who is recuperating at home with extensive burns on his body. \nThe industry is criticised for observing poor safety standards and paying as low as $3 (£1.85) a day to workers. \nThe industry rejects the charges, saying it contributes by running schools for the workers\' children and providing employment.\nIn the intense heat, when a lack of breeze meant it felt much hotter than the 36C (96F), we reached the Vinayaga Crackers\' factory.\nThe company, with \"interests in granite, agriculture and other items\", is the first to own an overseas fireworks warehouse in Durban, its brochure said.\nBehind its iron gates lay a vast expanse of open space dotted with match-box like rooms.\nInside, among heaps of material, were batches of men and women - all without gloves or masks, sitting on the floor, their hands moving deftly, eyes focussed. \nIt seemed like an open science lab with an array of dangerous chemicals and explosives. \nThese chemicals affect the lungs and masks must be worn, said a factory official, adding that some workers do suffer from tuberculosis.\nI met Bhawani, a middle-aged woman, who greeted me with a cautious smile. \nHer eyes were fixed on a silvery round box, packed with vertically placed rolled-up paper tubes filled with a mixture of aluminium powder, potassium nitrate and sulphur, and tipped with mud. \nIn an adjacent room, three women sifted through gunpowder, while others were inserting fuses. \n\"Why aren\'t they wearing gloves?\" I ask the factory\'s technical head Ravi Kumar. \n\"You cannot work fast if you do,\" he replies.\nAnother worker Narayanswamy\'s head was covered with a plastic sheet while his bare hands dipped in a silvery mixture of chemicals and his body and clothes carried the shine of aluminium powder. \n\"When we started our factory in 1982, my brother and I mixed chemicals and filled them in tubes, but we never faced any health problems,\" said company director P Ganesan, as he dismissed all talk of danger.  \nBut a senior officer with the federal security watchdog, the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), told the BBC that \"even humidity level changes can set off a chemical decomposition and a volatile reaction\".  \nA license for a fireworks factory comes through only after clearances from the local police, pollution, health and other departments, but a lack of coordination and the absence of routine official checks mean many factories do not follow safety norms.\nWorkers are expected to learn intricate procedures like mixing chemicals and explosives on the job. \nA PESO official said their brand new training centre has been lying unused for a year.\n\"Four officers are expected to monitor over 1,000 factories and hundreds of other units. How do you do that?\" he asked.\nAnd often, government officials assigned to monitor the factories themselves lack the technical qualification for the job. \nTwo years ago, four policemen and four government officials were killed during an inspection.\n\"No owner likes an accident for which he will be prosecuted, but one man\'s mistake means trouble for 100 others,\" said V Ramamoorthy, director of Jubilant Crackers factory, who blamed the frequent accidents on the management and \"mistakes\" by workers.

(68, 'Why a gay Indian professor\'s death inspired a film', '\nA professor from India\'s prestigious Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) died in 2010 after a video of him having sex with another man became public. Six years later, a Bollywood film revolving around his story is released on Friday. BBC Hindi\'s Vineet Khare spoke to the professor\'s partner and the TV news crew which filmed the controversial video.\nThe crew from a local TV station in the northern city of Aligarh secretly filmed Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, then 64, having sex with rickshaw puller Abdul (name changed) in his house inside the university campus on 8 February 2010.\nThe video led to public condemnation of Prof Siras by conservative religious groups.\nThe university administration suspended him and asked him to leave the campus. He was found dead in his apartment two months later. \nHis death drew widespread criticism of the university authorities. Many saw it as yet another case which highlighted the difficult lives of homosexuals in India.\nA colonial era law criminalises homosexuality in India. Also, in deeply conservative India, same-sex relationships are taboo and many people still regard them to be illegitimate.\nThe professor was in his bedroom with Abdul when local cable TV journalists Ashu Rizvi, Adil Murtaza and Siraj barged into his house.\nThe crew had already filmed the professor having sex with Abdul and wanted to confront the two men.\nThe video, given to the BBC by the university, shows Prof Siras repeatedly pleading with the three men to stop filming. \nThe professor, in an interview to TV channel NDTV, later called the filming an \"encroachment on my privacy\" and added that he felt \"angry\", \"ashamed\" and \"insulted\".\nAbdul still lives in constant fear of losing his livelihood, being recognised on the streets or even killed for being the professor\'s gay partner.\nThe \"horrible\" incident has stayed with him ever since and he misses his \"partner\".\n\"He loved me,\" says the father of five daughters, adding that \"a bit of greed\" may have guided his relationship with the professor.\n\"Had he been alive, my children would be studying in good schools. I would be running a business,\" he says. \nAbdul was born in Delhi in 1981, but his family moved to Aligarh, a three-hour drive from the national capital, in 1992. \nPoverty forced him to become a rickshaw puller in his teens to contribute to the family\'s income.\nHe met Prof Siras in 2009 outside the university\'s arts faculty, one of the many gathering spots for rickshaw pullers. \nHe \"enjoyed\" his relationship until the video filming incident happened. \nHe said he was \"shocked and scared\" and left Prof Siras\' house after the incident. That was the last time they saw each other.\nTwo months later, he heard on the news that Prof Siras had died. He was told his name was flashing across the media. He feared he would be blamed for the death. \nHe became increasingly worried when police began interrogating him. He said he was \"frustrated\" and one day he doused himself with kerosene and lit a match.\nHis wife saved his life.\n\"I thought it was better to die. I had done nothing wrong. My only fault was that I had shared a relationship with Prof Siras.\"\nHe has been living in fear since. He is alert at all times, always looking around suspiciously for anyone directly approaching him.\n\"If I die, who will look after my daughters? You know how women are looked down in our society,\" he said.\nLife has changed for the three journalists as well.\nAshu Rizvi, who ran a cable news business in 2010, is now in the real estate sector. He said Adil Murtaza now worked with an Urdu daily in Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, while Siraj worked at a meat factory.\nOver the phone, Mr Rizvi told me that they saw it as a \"legitimate story of uncovering the exploitation of a rickshaw puller by a university professor\".\nHe sees homosexual relationships as \"wrong in a country like India\".\nSome media reports had suggested that the university had a hand in the \"sting operation\" against the professor - an allegation denied by the authorities. \nMr Rizvi also denied that he was paid money and insisted that he saw it as a genuine story.\n\"We were tipped off by the rickshaw puller himself that he was being exploited by the professor. It was news, but we were targeted,\" he said.\nAbdul denied that he had approached the media.\n\"I never approached anybody. I still don\'t want any media attention,\" he said.\nBut he lives with the hope that one day some financial benefits may come his way for being the \"professor\'s lover\".', ' Aligarh Muslim University Bollywood Hindi Vineet Khare Aligarh Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras Abdul Ashu Rizvi Adil Murtaza Siraj Abdul Prof Siras Abdul Abdul Aligarh Poverty Prof Siras Prof Siras Siras Life Ashu Adil Murtaza Urdu Lucknow Uttar Pradesh Siraj Rizvi Rizvi Abdul', '26 2 2016'),

Under this law, a same-sex relationship is punishable by a 10-year jail term.\nIn its 2009 ruling, the Delhi High Court had described Section 377 as discriminatory and said gay sex between consenting adults should not be treated as a crime.\nThe ruling was widely and visibly welcomed by India\'s gay community, which said the judgement would help protect them from harassment and persecution.\nHowever, several political, social and religious groups petitioned the Supreme Court to have the law reinstated, and in 2013 the top court upheld the law, saying it was up to parliament to legislate on Section 377. \nHowever, an Indian MP\'s bid to introduce a private member\'s bill in the parliament to decriminalise gay sex failed. \nShashi Tharoor who also started a petition on Change.org over the issue, which has more than 40,000 signatories, said \"it is time to bring the Indian Penal Code into the 21st Century\".', ' Soutik Biswas Delhi High Court Shashi Tharoor', '2 2 2016'),

I found that wit intact when I spoke to him this morning on the cover that is making waves.\nWhy are you so angry?\nI am appalled by the Supreme Court judgement [criminalising gay sex]. The judgement is intellectually shallow and ethically hollow. \nIt is slipshod in its reasoning and pusillanimous with regard to defending fundamental rights. It was squarely in the province of the Supreme Court to decide the matter, but this normally activist court has kicked the football onto the pitch of an illiberal parliament.\nThe constitution protects the liberties and rights of Indian citizens. It is not for the judges to confer rights or take them away.  \nIt takes a fair amount to get me incensed. And a judgement which takes away the liberties of at least 50 million lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in India is scandalous, its inhumane - and if you wish, you can remove the e at the end of that word.  \nYet the way you have expressed your protest - posing on the cover of a magazine - is quite unprecedented.\nThere\'s nothing heroic in doing what I have done. \nThere are [gay] people who live lives of quiet desperation in India\'s towns and villages. They are bullied by their families and relatives. \nThey need people to voice their dismay and disappointments, people who present themselves as role models. People who, however reticent or reserved they are normally, can present themselves as role models. \nThere are several prominent India businessmen [who are gay] - who would be wonderful role models. That they don\'t come out is a sad dereliction of their responsibility to be sympathetic to those who are like them but much more powerless, lonely and isolated. \nCan you imagine the difference it would make if four or five widely admired people from different walks of life were to stand up and say: \'This is no big deal or I am bisexual\'? \nPeople who have come out in the freedom of the last four years since the high court judgement can\'t be simply pushed back into darkness of the closet.\nBut I am talking not of them in this respect, but of those people, full of self doubt or with bullying families who desperately need people to point to and say: \'They are like me too\'.\nSo how did this cover happen? \nPhotographer Rohit Chawla came up with the idea. \nHe shot over two sessions in the morning and evening at my residence. There is one set of pictures where I am clean shaven, by the way. \nThe night before the shoot had been busy and I had gone to bed late. So when Rohit arrived in the morning and found me in the state I was in, he said don\'t shave. \nHe came with two assistants,  lighting equipment. [But it] was pretty relaxed actually, we had a glass of rum. And then he said he would come in the evening and do another set of pictures - the clean shaven ones!\nRohit very much wanted this picture. He was generous enough to leave the final choice to me. I was rather scared of my parents\' opinion that I looked like an unshaven goonda (thug) [in the picture]. \nIn fact I am now shaving as we speak, so that I can redeem myself at lunch.\nI did finally agree to Rohit\'s choice because he said it would help get attention for the piece inside the magazine which I have written and, therefore, help the cause in general.\nYou look rather angry in the picture. Quite unlike you.\nMy expression came pretty easy. I had just read some parts of the illogical judgement. That\'s where my furrowed eyebrows come from. I hadn\'t shaved anyway.

(71, 'Why India\'s gay community is in shock', '\n\"We live in a dark, myopic age of hypocrisy, double standards & bullying!\" tweeted an Indian writer reacting to the Supreme Court decision to uphold a law which criminalises gay sex.\nThere\'s been widespread outrage in India\'s gay community, which is in shock after the country\'s top court reversed a landmark 2009 Delhi High Court ruling that had decriminalised homosexual acts.\nThe court has now left it to parliament to legislate on Section 377, a 153-year-old colonial law, under which a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\" and punishable by a 10-year jail term.\nOpposition to the 2009 ruling had come from more than a dozen political, social and religious groups and petitioners. \nThey put up an array of arguments, many of them bizarre and, some might say, disingenuous.\nOne petitioner was a TV astrologer who told the court the ruling \"compromises national defence since soldiers will start having sex with each other\". Another opponent of change was a former MP - he argued that it was \"against Indian culture\". \nLining up alongside them was an organisation called the Joint Action Committee. It said the 2009 ruling would \"increase male prostitution\", while a Christian church group said it \"harmed Christian interests\" and a Muslim group argued that \"sodomy is banned in Islam\". Perhaps most bizarrely, a spokesman for a popular yoga guru opposed the change, telling the court that he could \"cure homosexuality through yoga\".\nRanged against this were some four main groups who filed petitions supporting the Delhi court decision. \nThey included parents of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people with stories of how the colonial-era law had caused trauma to them and harmed their family lives; a group of more than a dozen psychiatrists and psychologists who treat LGBT \"patients\"; and some distinguished academics and leading Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal.\n\"Now the conservatives have won. This verdict is remarkable and bizarre. How can a court take away a fundamental right which has been already given to people? It is a huge setback for the gay community. And it makes India look thoroughly stupid internationally,\" leading social scientist Sanjay Srivastava told me.\nMost activists I spoke to believe that the judges had \"little sympathy\" for the gay community and had possibly had not met many homosexual people personally. They call the judgement India\'s Bowers v Hardwick moment, referring to a landmark 1986 US Supreme Court ruling upholding a law in Georgia that criminalised sex between consenting homosexuals. The ruling was later overturned in 2003. \nIt has never been easy to be openly gay in India, as I found out while doing a story on the community some years ago. Homosexuals face homophobia at work and struggle to find partners, as well as suffering from low self-esteem. \nHindu texts are ambiguous about homosexuality. Some texts, says scholar Wendy Doniger, \"punish homosexual acts with very minor fines, in dramatic comparison with much more serious punishment for infringements of heterosexual customs (heavy punishment for rape, for instance). The Kama Sutra, by contrast, is \"entirely non-judgemental in its description of men who have oral sex with other men\".\nThe 2009 judgement came as a shot in the arm for India\'s gay community. More and more of its members had begun to come out. \"The verdict is a severe blow to them,\" journalist and activist Vikram Doctor tells me. \"Once people come out of the closet, they just cannot go back.\"  ', ' Delhi High Court Joint Action Committee Islam Delhi Shyam Benegal Sanjay Srivastava Hardwick Georgia Wendy Doniger Vikram Doctor', '11 12 2013'),
(72, 'How myths and stereotypes colour rape sentencing in India', '\nIndia\'s Supreme Court once gave an array of curious reasons about why an Indian woman would not make a false rape claim. \nIn a 1983 judgement, the top court said that western and Indian women were vastly different. \nIn the West, the judges said a woman may level a false allegation of sexual molestation against a man because she may be a \"gold digger\", suffering from neurosis, hold grudges against men, want to gain notoriety, be jealous and so on.\n\"By and large these factors are not relevant in India,\" the judges said.\nThe court said an Indian woman in the \"tradition bound, non-permissive society\" would not lie about being sexually assaulted because such an allegation would lead to her being socially ostracised, \"risk losing the love and respect\" of her husband and relatives, and if unmarried she would fear the rape might hamper her prospects of getting married.\nMrinal Satish, a doctorate from Yale Law School who teaches at Delhi\'s National Law University, studied this and some 800 other judgements in all courts and found that myths and stereotypes often informed rape sentencing in India.  \n\"Rape myths are highly detrimental to rape victims. They are prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims and rapists,\" Dr Satish says in his latest work on reforming rape sentencing in India.\nFor one, Indian courts, according to law scholars like Ratna Kapur, have for long viewed the typical rape victim as \"chaste, pure, monogamous, honourable and confined to the domestic sphere\". She would generally be a \"virgin or a loyal wife\". \nCourts also refer to \"typical reactions\" by victims in court. One court referred to the demeanour of women raped by a guru in Tamil Nadu - two of them broke down while testifying, and another had felt giddy. In another case, the top court observed that a rape victim \"feels a deep sense of deathless shame\".  \nAlso, Dr Satish points to popular textbooks of medical jurisprudence followed by most courts perpetuating stereotypes regarding rape and victims - one states it is \"essential that the woman should resist to her utmost… It would not amount to rape if after half-hearted resistance she gave consent.\" \nAnother makes class distinctions, stating a woman belonging to a \"labour class\" who is \"accustomed to hard and rough work, will be able to deal blows on her assailant, and will thus succeed in frustrating his attempts at violation\". On the contrary, a well-to-do woman might not be able to resist for long, and might soon \"faint from fright or exhaustion\". \n\"Some high courts have actually used this as a basis to conclude that the allegation of rape was untrue on the ground that absence of injuries on the victim\'s body implied consent,\" says Dr Satish.\n\"It is troubling that these textbooks are considered an authoritative sources of medical jurisprudence by doctors. So doctors in India may be taught to believe that the presence of injuries on the victim\'s body is a pre-requisite for proving rape,\" he says.\nIn the last four decades the top court has frequently talked about the need for sensitivity in trials of rape cases, but has often failed to exhibit such sensitivity in the sentencing of these cases, says Dr Satish. \n\"My study shows the loss of chastity/virginity is viewed by courts as the primary \'harm\' that rape causes. However if the woman is perceived as unchaste, this impacts on sentencing. \n\"Since the law prevents courts from using chastity-related factors when trying to fix guilt during trial, the site of stereotyping has now moved to sentencing,  where wide discretion existed until recently.\"\nExamining the judgements, Dr Satish found that higher sentences were given to the convicted man when injuries are present on the body of the victim and sentences imposed on men convicted of raping unmarried woman were higher than those imposed on men convicted of raping married women. \n\"Thus loss of virginity, damage it causes to unmarried women appears to lead to higher sentences,\" he says.\nAlso, accused men who were relatives, neighbours, or had a relationship with the victim got lower sentences compared with strangers. Defendants convicted of raping victims with whom they had eloped were also given lower sentences in trial courts, high courts and the Supreme Court. \nHigh courts have reduced sentences in cases of elopement saying the offence had been committed because of \"reciprocal passion\" and \"out of youthful exuberance\".\nWomen rights lawyer Flavia Agnes told me things had improved since tough new anti-rape laws were introduced in the country after the brutal gang rape and murder of a student in 2012 in Delhi - although sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.\nFor one, the discretion of the judges has been reduced with the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for the convicted: seven years for non-aggravated rape and 10 years for aggravated rape.  \nThe definition of rape has also been expanded greatly to include oral sex and penetration of objects. A new law dealing with sexual abuse of children below 18 years is gender neutral to include boys. \nBut Dr Satish told me that there is evidence to prove that courts continue to perpetuate these stereotypes while sentencing men accused of rape. \n\"Judicial education focused on making judges aware of the stereotypes and biases that influence adjudication is a solution to the problem. Judicial academies conduct such programmes, and these should improve things in the long run,\" says Dr Satish.', ' Yale Law School Delhi Ratna Kapur Tamil Nadu Flavia Agnes Satish', '10 1 2017'),
(73, 'How WhatsApp helped turn an Indian village into a lynch mob', '\nA 32-year-old Indian software engineer has become the latest victim in a spate of mob lynchings, allegedly spurred by child abduction rumours spreading over WhatsApp. BBC Telugu\'s Deepthi Bathini reports on how the attack unfolded. \n\"They kept hitting us, demanding to know how many children we had kidnapped,\" says Mohammad Salman, who is still in shock, his body bruised and his face scarred with stitches.\nOn 13 July, Mr Salman, 22, and his two friends were brutally beaten by a mob that suspected them of kidnapping children. The last thing he remembers seeing was his friend, Mohammad Azam, being dragged away with a noose around his neck. Mr Azam died from his injuries. \nThe three men were visiting relatives in Handikera, a tiny village surrounded by lush fields in the southern state of Karnataka. They lived in Hyderabad, the capital city of the neighbouring state of Telangana. They had driven to the village along with two other friends to spend the weekend there.\nBut within hours of arriving, all five of them were branded child abductors and attacked by angry villagers. The idyllic weekend soon turned deadly. Police have since arrested 22 people, including the administrator of a WhatsApp group. They said they have also deleted 20 Whatsapp groups as a precaution. \n\"We obtained videos recorded by eyewitnesses and looked at them frame-by-frame. We started analysing the videos to determine who was attacking and who was defending. If we find any more, we will arrest them as well,\" said a senior police officer. \nAt least 17 others have allegedly been killed in India over child kidnapping rumours since April 2018. In all of these cases, police say, the rumours were spread via messages on WhatsApp. \nInvestigations into these incidents have shown that people often forwarded false messages or doctored videos to large groups, some with more than 100 participants. And violent mobs would gather quickly and attack strangers, leaving police little time to respond. \nThis appears to be what happened in Handikera too. \nMr Salman says they were driving towards the lake on the outskirts of the village when they saw a group of children returning home from school. He said one of his friends was carrying chocolates and decided to give them to the children. But since the car was moving fast, he threw the chocolates out of the window. \nMr Salman says they never stopped and they kept driving until they reached the lake. They laid out foldable chairs and sat down to relax. \n\"Before we realised what was happening, villagers gathered and started accusing us of being child abductors,\" recalls Mohammad Afroz, who was also part of Mr Salman\'s group. \nIt\'s unclear why the villagers suspected them of being child abductors. \n\"We tried reasoning with them but it was of no use. They started pelting stones at the car and hitting my friends.\"\nMr Afroz phoned his uncle, Mohammad Yakub, who rushed to the spot but the villagers wouldn\'t listen to him either. \nPolice later found a video of the altercation on the phone of a man who was allegedly part of the mob. He shared the video on a WhatsApp group with 200 members. When Mr Salman, Mr Azam and a third friend, Salham Ali, managed to escape in the car, villagers in the mob realised they were heading in the direction of the neighbouring village, Murki. \nAccording to the police, someone in the mob called a friend in Murki and told him to watch out for a red car with child kidnappers. \nMr Afroz and the fifth man, Noor Mohammad, were left behind near the lake but they escaped because the mob followed the car. \n\"We thought the issue was resolved and we would meet the others soon,\" says Mr Afroz. \"But within five minutes, I got a call that their car had fallen into a ditch in Mukri.\"\nMr Salman says villagers in Murki had blocked the road with logs, and because they had been driving so fast, the car overturned when they tried to swerve. \n\"They started pelting the car with stones and broke the windows with sticks and stones. I was dragged out and beaten badly,\" he says.\n\"They hit us with knives, sickles and sticks. There were also women in the mob.\"\nA video which the police have obtained from eyewitnesses shows a loud, angry mob surrounding the overturned car. A helpless police officer can be seen pleading with the mob with to leave the men alone.\nMr Salman adds that he and his friend, Mr Ali, survived because the police hid them in the boot of the car to protect them. But they could not save Mr Azam. Mr Salman says some villagers also tried to help them but the mob was too large to control. \nBy some estimates, it was made up of hundreds of people. \n\"I think there were around 1,000 people,\" says Vijay Patil, an eyewitness who owns a tea stall in Murki. \n\"We all received the video on the group,\" he says, adding that he left the group that night after seeing what a \"single video on WhatsApp had done\".\nMr Salman says the crowd didn\'t disperse for more than an hour, until five police vehicles arrived as reinforcement. By then, the mob had injured eight officers who had been trying to stop them.  \nMallikarjun, a police constable who did not wish to reveal his last name, broke several bones in his leg that night. He says he hasn\'t been able to sleep since then. \n\"I wake up scared,\" he says. \"The faces of the three men inside the car, pleading for their lives, with their folded hands and bleeding faces, keep flashing in my head.\"  \nThe district administration say they had conducted awareness programmes in the villages after recent lynchings. \"Even after all our efforts, this incident is very unfortunate,\" says one official who was involved in the campaign.   \nThe village appears shaken by the incident. Murki has a population of 5,000 and is generally quiet. Police say they were not equipped to confront such a large, violent mob.

Many of the messages that are believed to have triggered violence were forwarded to multiple groups which had more than 100 members each. \nIn a blog published on its website, the company announced that it was \"launching a test to limit forwarding that will apply to everyone using WhatsApp\". \nFor Indian users, however, the forwarding option will be limited even further. A WhatsApp spokesperson told the BBC that this means a single person would be able to forward one message only five times.\nHowever, this does not stop other members from a group from forwarding the message to a further five chats of their own. \nWhatsApp added that they hoped this measure would curb the frequency of messages being forwarded.\nThe company also said it would be removing the \"quick forward button\" next to messages containing pictures or video.\nThese changes come in the wake of a series of mob lynchings that have seen at least 18 people killed across India since April 2018. Media reports put the number of dead higher.\nThe violence has been blamed on rumours of child kidnappings, spread over WhatsApp, which have led people to attack strangers.\nPolice say it is proving hard to get people to believe that the messages are false.\nIn a recent lynching in the north-eastern state of Tripura, the victim was a man employed by the local government to go around villages to dispel rumours being spread on social media.\nIndia\'s federal government had earlier warned WhatsApp, a Facebook-owned company, that it could not evade \"accountability and responsibility\" for the content its users were sharing. \nWhatsApp had responded by saying it was \"horrified by these terrible acts of violence\", and that the situation was a \"challenge that requires government, civil society and technology companies to work together\". \nThe messaging app is the single largest internet-based service available to people in India. It has tremendous reach, allowing messages to spread exponentially and enabling mobs to gather quickly.\nEarlier this month, the company outlined steps it was taking to help address the problem, which included enabling users to leave groups and block people more easily.

(75, 'India election 2019: The mystery of 21 million \'missing\' women voters', '\nIndian women got the right to vote the year their country was born. It was, as a historian said, a \"staggering achievement for a post-colonial nation\". But more than 70 years later, why are 21 million women in India apparently being denied the right to vote?\nIt is one of India\'s many social riddles. \nWomen have been enthusiastic voters in India: voter turnout among women will be higher in this year\'s general election than that of men. Most women say they are voting independently, without consulting their spouses and families. \nTo make them secure, there are separate queues for women at polling stations and female police officers guarding them. Polling stations contain at least one female officer. \nMore than 660 women candidates contested the 2014 elections, up from 24 in the first election in 1951. And political parties now target women as a separate constituency, offering them cheap cooking gas, scholarships for studies and bicycles to go to college.\nYet, a truly astonishing number of women - equal to the population of Sri Lanka - appear to be \"missing\" from India\'s voters lists. \nIn their upcoming book, The Verdict: Decoding India\'s Elections, poll experts Prannoy Roy and Dorab Sopariwala find that the available data on women points to this. \nThey looked at the number of women above the age of 18 in the census, extrapolated it, and compared it to the number of women in the latest list of voters. And they found a sizeable \"shortfall\" - 21 million to be exact - in the number of female voters. \nThree states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan - accounted for more than half of the missing female voters. Southern states such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu fare better.\nWhat does this mean? \nMore than 20 million missing women, analysts say, translates into 38,000 missing women voters on average in every constituency in India. In places like Uttar Pradesh, India\'s most populous and a key bellwether state, the figure swells to 80,000 missing women in every seat. \nGiven that more than one in every five seats are won or lost by a margin of fewer than 38,000 votes, the missing women could swing the results in many seats. The absence of a large number of women also means that India\'s electorate would be higher than the 900 million people who are eligible to vote in the summer elections. If the sex ratio in a constituency is skewed against women and the average voter is male, the preferences of female voters are likely to be ignored.\n\"Women want to vote, but they are not allowed to vote. This is deeply worrying. It also raises a lot of questions. We know that there are some social reasons behind this problem. But we also know that by controlling turnouts you can control results. Is that one of the reasons? We really need to investigate further to get to the truth,\" Prannoy Roy told me.\nWith a sex ratio that is skewed in favour of men, India has had a problem of missing women for a long time. \nLast year, a government report found that 63 million women were \"missing\" from India\'s population because the preference for sons led to sex-selective abortions and more care was given to boys. Separately, economists Shamika Ravi and Mudit Kapoor estimated that more than 65 million women - some 20% of the female electorate - were missing. This included women who were not registered to vote and women \"who were not in the population because of gross neglect\" (worsening sex ratio, which reflected the gross neglect). So elections, they said, were \"revealing the preferences or the will of a population that is artificially skewed against women\".\nIt\'s not that election authorities haven\'t worked hard to get more women to vote. \nThe Election Commission adopts a rigorous statistical method - gender ratios, elector-population ratios and ages of voters - to make sure that eligible voters are not left out. There is doorstep verification of voters and a substantial number of officials involved in this exercise are women. In villages, child welfare workers and women\'s self-help groups are roped in. State-run TV and radio programmes motivate women to register. There are even polling stations dedicated exclusively to women.\nSo why are so many women still missing from the rolls? Is it because many women shift residence after marriage and fail to register anew? (Less than 3% of Indian women aged 30-34 are single.) Is it because families still refuse to provide photographs of women to officials to publish in voters lists? Or does this exclusion have something to do with the \"dark arts of voter suppression\"?  \n\"There is some social resistance, but it doesn\'t explain such large scale exclusion,\" says Dr Roy. \nPeople who have helped organise elections in India say there is no reason to panic. Former election commissioner SY Quraishi told me that the enrolment of women had gone up steadily over the years. \"There is social resistance to enrolling women still,\" he says. \n\"I have heard of parents not registering their daughter because they don\'t want to reveal her age, because they feel it will end up hurting their prospects for marriage. We have also been sometimes indifferent in our outreach to rope in more women voters,\" he said.\nWith the 2019 elections barely a month away, there\'s no time to fix this problem. Dr Roy believes there\'s only one way out - to let women vote even if they are not registered. \n\"Any woman who comes to a polling station and wants to cast her vote, and can prove she is 18 years old, must be allowed to vote,\" he says.

(76, 'India transgender gurus in landmark Hindu procession', '\nThe northern Indian city of Allahabad witnessed a historic procession on Sunday led by a Hindu congregation of transgender people. Photojournalist Ankit Srinivas reports. \nThousands thronged the streets of Allahabad to seek blessings from transgender sadhus (holy people), ahead of the Kumbh Mela festival, which is set to begin in the city on 15 January and will continue until 4 March. \nIt is one of Hinduism\'s holiest events and billed as the world\'s largest religious gathering. \nIt has been taking place every few years over centuries. Four different northern cities, all along the banks of a holy river, take turns hosting it. Hindus believe that taking a dip in these rivers during the Kumbh will wash away their sins and help them attain salvation. So, tens of millions gather at the festival to do just that. \nIn the days leading up to the Kumbh, each of Hinduism\'s 13 official Akharas or congregations embark on processions to mark their arrival at the festival. \nThese processions are highly coveted as people line up to see holy men and women perched on top of heavily decorated floats.\nSunday\'s procession was different. It had the usual fanfare - floats, musical bands, camels and horses - but the sadhus were all transgender. \nAccording to one estimate, India has about two million transgender people. But it wasn\'t until 2014 that the Supreme Court recognised them as a third gender in a historic ruling.\nThen in 2018 the court ruled that gay sex was no longer a crime, overturning a colonial-era law. \n\"Those were significant victories but now the fight to get us social acceptance and our presence at the Kumbh is another step in that direction,\" said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, the head of the transgender congregation, which is known as the Kinnar Akhara. \nHindu mythology and scriptures are full of references to transgender people  - some Hindu gods and goddesses are transgender too. But rights groups say the community is ostracised and faces huge discrimination because of their gender identity. \nThe Kinnar Akhara has been battling the other congregations to lead such a procession. Finally, they chose to do it despite being denied official recognition. \n\"Transgender people have been mentioned throughout Hindu mythology. You can\'t just wish us away,\" said Atharv, a member of the Kinnar Akhara, who goes by first name only. \n\"If there can be 13 Akharas for men and women, why not one for transgender people?\" \nSome of the other Akharas say that they are centuries-old and cannot allow the creation of a new congregation that easily. \n\"The Kumbh is a place where everybody is welcome and we welcome transgender people as well. But they can\'t be recognised as an Akhara,\" said Vidyanand Saraswati, spokesperson of the Juna Akhara, which is the biggest of the 13 Akharas. \n\"If anybody wants to spread spirituality and religion, we are not opposed to that. But they should leave certain matters to us,\" he added.\nBut some religious leaders do support the Kinnar Akhara. \n\"Hinduism has always acknowledged and accepted the presence of transgender people,\" Atmananda Maharaj, a priest at a prominent temple in northern India, told me.  \n\"They are only asking for what is rightfully theirs. Why should we deny them?\"\nThis isn\'t the first time the Kinnar Akhara has led such a procession - they did it at the Kumbh  in 2016, which was held in the northern city of Ujjain. \n\"Leading the procession in Allahabad is special because it\'s one of the holiest cities in Hinduism and the Kumbh Mela here is more auspicious and larger than in any other place,\" said Atharv.\nBut members of the Kinnar Akhara said it took them two years to get a plot of land at the site of this year\'s festival - each congregation is allotted space to set up camp.\nAtharv said the fight was worth it. \n\"We respect the Akharas who oppose us. I am sure that someday they will realise that Hinduism respects everyone, including transgender people. For now, our fight is not to be recognised as an Akhara but to make people realise our religious, spiritual and social identity. Looking at the crowds that welcomed us, I feel we are doing something right.\" \nThere was excitement among the devotees who sought blessings from the transgender sadhus as well as selfies and videos of them. \n\"We always respect transgender people and seek their blessings during happy occasions like child birth and marriages,\" said Abhay Shukla, a resident of Allahabad. \n\"But I had never imagined to see them as gurus. It\'s a different experience for us.\" \nMembers of the Akhara believe that this procession is a milestone in the fight for transgender rights in India.\n\"The crowds today made us believe that change is possible,\" said Bhawani Ma, another member. \n\"I never thought that we would get such support from people. The Kumbh has shown us that the future holds good things for us. We have suffered neglect, abuse and segregation for generations and that is why seeing the crowds meant so much to us.\" \nMr Shukla seemed to agree with this sentiment. \n\"For me, spirituality matters,\" he said. \n\"I don\'t care if my guru is a man, a woman or a transgender person. I know that many people don\'t see it this way but they will change when they come to the Kumbh and see the Kinnar Akhara.\"\nPhotographs by Ankit Srinivas.', ' Allahabad Hindu Photojournalist Ankit Srinivas Kumbh Mela Kumbh Hinduism Kumbh Laxmi Narayan Tripathi Kinnar Akhara Atharv Kinnar Akhara Akhara Vidyanand Saraswati Juna Akhara Kinnar Akhara Atmananda Maharaj Kinnar Akhara Hinduism Kumbh Mela Atharv Kinnar Akhara Atharv Hinduism Akhara Abhay Shukla Akhara Bhawani Ma Shukla Kumbh Kinnar Akhara Photographs Ankit Srinivas', '7 1 2019');

Most make a living by singing and dancing or by begging and prostitution.\nBy Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi\nMembers of the third gender have played a prominent role in Indian culture and were once treated with great respect. They find mention in the ancient Hindu scriptures and were written about in the greatest epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. \nIn medieval India too, they played a prominent role in the royal courts of the Mughal emperors and some Hindu rulers. Many of them rose to powerful positions.\nTheir fall from grace started in the 18th Century during the British colonial rule when the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorised the entire transgender community as \"criminals\" who were \"addicted\" to committing serious crimes. They were arrested for dressing in women\'s clothing or dancing or playing music in public places, and for indulging in gay sex.\nAfter Independence, the law was repealed in 1949, but mistrust of the transgender community has continued. Even today, they remain socially excluded, living on the fringes of society, in ghettoised communities, harassed by the police and abused by the public. Most make a living by singing and dancing at weddings or to celebrate child birth, many have moved to begging and prostitution. \nIt is hoped that the landmark court ruling will help bring them into the mainstream and improve their lot.\nRights groups say they often face huge discrimination and that sometimes hospitals refuse to admit them. \nThey have been forced to choose either male or female as their gender in most public spheres.\n\"Recognition of transgenders as a third gender is not a social or medical issue but a human rights issue,\" Justice KS Radhakrishnan, who headed the two-judge Supreme Court bench, said in his ruling on Tuesday.\n\"Transgenders are also citizens of India\" and they must be \"provided equal opportunity to grow\", the court said.\n\"The spirit of the Constitution is to provide equal opportunity to every citizen to grow and attain their potential, irrespective of caste, religion or gender.\"\nThe judges asked the government to treat them in line with other minorities officially categorised as \"socially and economically backward\", to enable them to get quotas in jobs and education.\n\"We are quite thrilled by the judgement,\" Anita Shenoy, lawyer for the petitioner National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), told the BBC.\n\"The court order gives legal sanctity to the third gender. The judges said the government must make sure that they have access to medical care and other facilities like separate wards in hospitals and separate toilets,\" she said. \nProminent transgender activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, who was among the petitioners in the case, welcomed the judgement, saying the community had long suffered from discrimination and ignorance in the traditionally conservative country, reports the Agence France-Presse news agency. \n\"Today, for the first time I feel very proud to be an Indian,\" Ms Tripathi told reporters outside the court in Delhi.\nIn 2009, India\'s Election Commission took a first step by allowing transgenders to choose their gender as \"other\"  on ballot forms.\nBut India is not the first country to recognise a third gender. Nepal recognised a third gender as early as in 2007 when the Supreme Court ordered the government to scrap all laws that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  And last year, Bangladesh also recognised a third gender.\nTuesday\'s ruling comes after the Supreme Court\'s decision in December which criminalised gay sex by reversing a landmark 2009 Delhi High Court order which had decriminalised homosexual acts.\nAccording to a 153-year-old colonial-era law - Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code - a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\" and punishable by a 10-year jail term.\nLegal experts say Tuesday\'s judgement puts transgender people in a strange situation: on the one hand, they are now legally recognised and protected under the Constitution, but on the other hand they may be breaking the law if they have consensual gay sex.', ' Geeta Delhi Members Hindu Ramayana Mahabharata Anita Shenoy Laxmi Narayan Tripathi Agence Tripathi Delhi Nepal Bangladesh Delhi High Court', '15 4 2014'),

The government sets prices for farming in India and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support.\nThe protesters also wanted tribal farmers, who mainly cultivate in forests, to be allowed to own land.\nFarmers\' leader Vijay Javandhia told BBC Marathi that \"agricultural income has swiftly declined in the country\".\n\"Income in cotton, grains and pulses is declining day by day. That\'s why the rural economy is gradually running out of money,\" he said.\nSakhubai, a 65-year-old woman farmer from Nashik, said: \"We need our land and this is our prime demand.\n\"I have injured my feet due to excessive walking, but I will continue to protest until our demands are met.\"\nDharmraj Shinde, one of the organisers of the march, said \"we are fighting for our land\".\n\"The government should give us ownership because it\'s our right as tribal people,\" he said.\nSenior journalist P Sainath, who has covered farming issues for decades, told BBC Marathi that the government must listen. \n\"Consider how difficult it is for tribals who are fighting for forest land rights, consider how difficult it is for extremely poor women who are around 60 or 70 years to march from Nashik to Mumbai in such a hot climate,\" he said.\n\"And they are away from their work for five days.\"\nWe are here to protest against the unfair policies adopted by the state government of Maharashtra with respect to farmers. \nI had borrowed 40,000 rupees ($615; £444) under a \"crop loan\" (loans for farmers to buy fertilisers, seeds and other materials required for farming). \nThe state government announced in June 2017 that it was waiving loans to help farmers in debt.

(79, 'Why are farmers in India protesting with mice and human skulls?', '\nLast week, Chinnagodangy Palanisamy, 65, held a live mouse between his teeth to draw the government\'s attention to the plight of farmers in his native state of Tamil Nadu.\n\"I and my fellow farmers were trying to convey the message that we will be forced to eat mice if things don\'t improve,\" he told me, sitting in a makeshift tent near Delhi\'s Jantar Mantar observatory, one of the areas of the Indian capital where protests are permitted. \nThe tatty tent and the street outside have been home to Mr Palanisamy and his 100-odd fellow farmers for some 40 days now. They hail from drought-affected districts of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, one of India\'s most developed states. \nIt appears to be a drought that India forgot, so Mr Palanisamy and his spirited co-protesters mounted a unique, eye-catching protest to put pressure on the government to act. \nThey are demanding ample drought relief funds, pensions for elderly farmers, a waiver on the repayment of crop and farm loans, better prices for their crops and the interlinking of rivers to irrigate their lands. \nWearing traditional sarong-like garments and turbans, these farmers have brandished human skulls that they claim belong to dead farmers. \nThey have held live mice in their mouths, shaved half their heads, worn women\'s traditional saris, slashed their hands and oozed \"protest blood\", rolled bare-bodied on boiling hot macadam, and conducted mock funerals. \nThe protesters have also eaten food off the road, and stripped near the prime minister\'s office in the heart of the city after they were reportedly refused a meeting. \nFire-fighters rescued a protester who tied a noose around his neck and tried to hang himself from a tree at the venue. Many of them have been taken to the hospital and treated for acute dehydration.\nSome complain that the famously inward-looking Delhi media have painted their protest as an exotic freak show, often missing the pain and desperation driving it. \nOne commentator wrote that the protest had taken on a \"farcical proportion where the performance seems to have become the point of it, and the protest itself is lost\". \nIn Tamil Nadu, where more than 40% of the people make a living from farming, lack of water due to poor rainfall, low crop prices, and dwindling access to formal credit has created what is possibly the state\'s worst agrarian crisis in decades.\nThe jury is out on whether this protest will fetch results. India, after all, has seen many abortive uprisings. But this Delhi protest shines the spotlight on how drought, debt and dysfunctional policies continue to blight India\'s farmers: agriculture growth has shrunk to a worrying 1.2%, and tens of thousands of farmers are struggling with debt and little income.\nThere was a time not so long ago, recounts Mr Palanisamy, when his 4.5-acre farm in Tiruchirappalli would yield abundant rice, sugarcane, pulses and cotton. There was also a bountiful crop of fruit from his mango and coconut trees.\nCrippled by a debilitating drought brought on by years of poor rainfall, Mr Palanisamy\'s farm is now largely barren. \nTwo of his sons, who helped their father farm, have been forced to take up small jobs to keep the home fires burning. There\'s no money to pay his five workers. Loans worth 6,00,000 rupees ($9,287; £7,247) have piled up, and he\'s already pawned a lot of family gold as collateral.\n\"This is the worst farm crisis I have seen in my lifetime,\" says Mr Palanisamy, a second generation farmer, whose lean and sinewy frame belies his age. \"I have never lived through such a crisis.\"\nMany haven\'t. Fifty-eight debt-stricken farmers have taken their lives in drought-affected districts in Tamil Nadu since October, according to officials. A local farmers association insists the number of farm-related suicides and death of farmers is more than 250.\nOne of them is Mr Palanisamy\'s own brother-in-law who fell ill, refused treatment, and \"wasted himself to death\" in November. He was crushed under loans that he had taken out to buy a tractor and a bore well to irrigate his five-acre farm. \nLed by a charismatic sixty-something farmer-lawyer, the protesters at Jantar Mantar have unwavering spirit. Most of them, like Mr Palanisamy, took a train ride to Delhi in March and found the weather \"rather cold\". At night, many of them slept fitfully in the open, enduring mosquito bites.\nThe farmers tell stories of their denuded villages where lack of water has left their trees bare and the landscape barren. They swap stories of mounting crop loans taken from banks and money lenders. They rave and rant in their dog-eared diaries. On some days, the mercury soars to 45C (113F)\nSome of them complain that the media is more interested in the spectacle than the problem. They are men and women of dignity who have fought hard all their lives against all odds. \nMr Palanisamy, for example, belongs to a hunter-gatherer tribe, among the most underprivileged people in India. He studied until high school, picked up a certificate as a recognised farm teacher, and was employed at an anganwadi - a government sponsored mother and child-care centre - until his retirement even as he tilled his farm. \nHis three sons have been equally hardworking - two of them have earned degrees in engineering - and have helped their father in the farm. His brother-in-law, who took his life, used the money he earned from farming to send his only daughter to a nursing school. \nThey are symbols of the hard-fought social mobility of India\'s poorest, and also examples of how a long-drawn farm crisis can return them to a precarious existence. \nWhen dusk falls, and the noise recedes, Mr Palanisamy sometimes takes out his diary and scribbles furiously. He said he recently wrote some verse, remembering the hard times back home. It is a haunting elegy for farming in India:\nIt\'s dead/it\'s dead/Farming is dead\nIt\'s agony/it\'s agony/This death of farming\nIt\'s burning/it\'s burning\nThe farmers heart and belly\nStop this/stop this\nThese farmers\' deaths', ' Tamil Nadu Delhi Jantar Mantar Tamil Nadu Delhi Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu Jantar Mantar Delhi March', '21 4 2017'),

(85, 'How India viral messages helped catch rape suspect', '\nViral WhatsApp messages spreading rumours have been blamed for a spate of recent lynchings across India. But police in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh used the platform to track down a rape suspect, reports BBC Hindi\'s Nitin Srivastava.\nThe victim, a seven-year-old girl, was reported missing on 26 June by her parents when she didn\'t return home from school in the town of Mandsaur.\nThe following morning, a vegetable seller found the girl bleeding and unconscious behind a bus stop in a quieter part of the town.\nShe was rushed to a local hospital where doctors confirmed that she had been raped. She is still recovering from grievous injuries, including stab wounds.\nAs news of the brutal attack spread quickly in the small town of some 200,000 people, hundreds of them poured onto the streets demanding justice for the girl.\nBut the police had no leads because the CCTV cameras at the school were not working and there were no witnesses either. The victim was not in a position to give any statement. \nDesperate in the face of mounting public anger, police reached out to people who ran businesses near the girl\'s school to obtain CCTV footage.\nAfter scanning 400 hours of footage, the police finally ended up with three different clips, which showed a girl in a school uniform walking with a frail, young man. She appeared to have walked away with him after he offered her sweets.\nThe victim\'s parents identified the girl in the video as their daughter but the man\'s face was not clearly visible. But police were able to recognise the brand of his sports shoes. \nThat\'s when the police decided to share the three video clips from the CCTV footage widely on social media, hoping someone would recognise the suspect. They realised the risk - rumours of child kidnappings, spread over WhatsApp, had led mobs to lynch strangers across India in the past few months. What if these messages were manipulated to incite people?\nMandsaur was no stranger to communal frenzy either. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have flared up here in the past over issues related to cow-slaughter and religious processions. \nPolice admitted that rumours had already begun spreading on WhatsApp and via text messages about the victim\'s and the suspect\'s religious identity. \"Pictures of her along with fake messages of her being dead began circulating,\" Manoj Singh, the town\'s police chief, said. \nSo, they informed community leaders, local politicians and local residents\' associations before they began circulating the video on various WhatsApp and Facebook groups. \nPolice said, much to their relief, both communities worked together to help identify the suspect.\n\"We felt this was a criminal case and should not be given a religious colour. It could happen to anyone\'s daughter,\" Jitendra Rathore, local chief of the right-wing Hindu organisation Bajrang Dal, said. \nThe police control room received more than a dozen tips in response, based on which they narrowed their search down to seven suspects. \nAnd they began searching Facebook for accounts that matched one of them. \nThree days later, police zeroed in on one main suspect based on his Facebook profile. One of the major clues was the shoes which they had already identified in the CCTV footage. \nThey have arrested two men in connection with the case.

(86, 'Who can stop India WhatsApp lynchings?', '\nIndia\'s government has asked messaging service WhatsApp to act urgently to halt the spread of \"irresponsible and explosive messages\" on its platform after a spate of deadly attacks. But will it have any effect, asks the BBC\'s Ayeshea Perera. \nThe statement comes amid a spate of mob lynchings that have killed at least 17 people across India in the last three months. Media reports put the number of dead higher. \nThe violence has been blamed on rumours of child kidnappings, spread over WhatsApp, which have led people to attack strangers.\nPolice say it is proving hard to get people to believe that the messages are false.\nIn one of the most recent lynchings, in the north-eastern state of Tripura, the victim was a man employed by local government officials to go around villages with a loudspeaker, asking locals not to believe the rumours being spread on social media. \nThe Indian government said the company cannot evade \"accountability and responsibility\" for the content its users are sharing.\nThe spate of attacks is increasingly alarming and shows no sign of abating. \nIndia\'s telecom regulatory commission says there are more than one billion active mobile phone connections in India, and millions of Indians have started getting online in a very short space of time.\nFor the vast majority of them, their first point of contact to the internet is through their mobile phone.\n\"Suddenly people from rural areas in particular are inundated with information and are unable to distinguish what is real from what is not. They tend to believe whatever is sent to them,\" Pratik Sinha, the founder of fact-checking website Alt news, told the BBC in an earlier interview. \nWith an estimated 200 million users, India is WhatsApp\'s biggest market. It is also the single largest internet-based service available to people in the country. This means it has tremendous reach, allowing not only messages to spread exponentially, but also enabling mobs to gather quickly. \nBecause it is primarily a personal messaging app, people are more inclined to believe information they receive through it, because it comes to them via family and friends. Therefore, the inclination to double check is very low.\nThis is only going to get worse when India adds its next 300 million internet users in the next three years, technology analyst Prasanto K Roy told the BBC. They will be non-English speakers, and most will be lower down the socio-economic pyramid with lower levels of literacy, he says. They will consume mostly video and music. \n\"Video is the easiest of platforms for fake news. It\'s so easy to misrepresent: just find any old video of a fight or a brutal killing on the internet, describe it as something recent and inflammatory, and send it out. In minutes, it goes viral, racing around on Facebook and WhatsApp.\" \nAnd the technology it uses has made the situation even more complicated. \nWhatsApp is encrypted end to end, at the smartphone itself, and messages are not stored on WhatsApp\'s servers. \nThe company itself says this: \"Only you and the person you\'re communicating with can read what\'s sent - and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp\" and  \"WhatsApp does not store messages once they are delivered or transaction logs of such delivered messages\".\"However, some metadata (such as who called or texted whom) is stored, and has been reportedly shared with US federal law enforcement after court orders,\" says Mr Roy.\nThe fact that the service employs end-to-end encryption means it differs from services like China\'s WeChat, which has to comply with Chinese law that enables the state to monitor messages. It is more similar in nature to apps like Signal or Telegram, but those are not used by many people in India.\nThe government seems to be out of its depth. Law and order officials apparently are at a loss over how to deal with messages going viral on WhatsApp, and or how to engage with technology companies to get them to do something. \nThe company has told the government that it is also \"horrified by these terrible acts of violence\", calling the situation a \"challenge that requires government, civil society and technology companies to work together\".\nWhile it has declined to make changes to the way it encrypts messages because \"the way people use the app is by nature still very private\", it has outlined several steps it is taking to help address the problem.\nThis includes enabling users to leave groups and block people more easily.  WhatsApp is also planning to run long-term public safety ad campaigns in India, the statement said, adding it had already tied up with local organisations to help dispel rumours being spread on its platform. \nThe company also said it planned to start an engagement programme with law enforcement officials, helping them share best practice for how WhatsApp is used by local police as a resource for their community. \nIt is also labelling messages that have been forwarded from somewhere else. But Mr Roy says this does not show you how much a message has been forwarded. \nThat depends on who you talk to. \nNikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of the Medianama website, says WhatsApp needs to evolve to help stop the problem. \n\"Of course platforms like WhatsApp are enablers of free speech and should not be censored. But that doesn\'t mean they don\'t have a responsibility in situations like this,\" he told the BBC. \nMr Pahwa says there are several practical measures the platform can use. \n\"For instance, all messages should be treated as private. This means that people will no longer have the ability to copy-paste or forward messages. Anything that is forwarded will need to be made public and this could generate a message ID that can then be tracked,\" he said.\nHis other suggestions include enabling users to flag objectionable content and making first-time users watch a mandatory video that explains how the platform works. \nMr Roy says however, that merely targeting the \"messenger\", when the biggest disseminators of misinformation on WhatsApp are political parties, is disingenuous.\n\"This needs to be tackled at the source. Political parties, particularly the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] need to take a more disciplined stand about using WhatsApp. \nLike a no-first use nuclear policy, maybe the answer is for all political parties to pledge not to use it to spread misinformation,\" he says. \nFrom a legal standpoint, while a message like this from the government would worry WhatsApp, it is protected under the Indian IT Act\'s Intermediary Guidelines, which recognises that such platforms are intermediaries and thus cannot be held accountable for content shared on them, with certain conditions.\nMr Roy says that while these guidelines specify a \"take down\" process for websites to remove objectionable content, it is unclear what needs to be done with encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp, where traditional \"takedowns\" are not easy to implement.', ' Ayeshea Perera Tripura Pratik Sinha Roy Facebook WhatsApp Nikhil', '5 7 2018'),

Villagers armed themselves and began attacking anyone they did not recognise, with tragic results. \nUnlike in western countries, most of India\'s fake news spreads via WhatsApp and mobile phone messages, because for a majority of Indians, their first point of exposure to the internet is via their phone. \nIndia\'s telecom regulatory commission says there are more than one billion active mobile phone connections in India, and millions of Indians have started getting online in a very short space of time. \n\"Reach has exploded, thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and cheap data packages.

They tend to believe whatever is sent to them.\"\nMr Sinha is one of a handful of people trying to \"fight\" the scourge of fake news in India. \nFormerly a software engineer, he now runs Altnews fulltime, funding it with his own savings and ad revenue. \nAltnews fact checks viral stories circulating on social media and WhatsApp, verifies photographs and videos and also calls out stories by media organisations that may be based on fake news.\nStories he has debunked include a viral video claiming to show a Hindu girl being lynched by a Muslim mob. The video, Mr Sinha says, regularly does the rounds on WhatsApp with a plea to the receiver to send on the message with the hope that authorities will be pressurised into taking action.\nBut the video though horrific, is actually of a Guatemalan girl being beaten by a mob and is two years old.  \nIn fact a majority of the videos, Mr Sinha has said, seem to be propagated by people with hardline sensibilities and many have an \"anti-Muslim\" slant. \nPart of the challenge, he adds, is that WhatsApp, which is the main medium of fake news in India, is \"like a mutating virus\".\n\"WhatsApp has end to end encryption. What that means is every message sent between two parties has a unique set of keys, regardless of whether it is the same message being passed on. This means that when fake news happens, there is no trail. It becomes tough for even WhatsApp to track.\"\nThe other issue, according to Durga Raghunath, an Indian digital expert, is that people don\'t question sources on social networks or messaging apps. \n\"The mental approach is different. Many of the issues people see on these platforms have an emotional connect, and because the information comes to us via family and friends, the inclination to double check is very low,\" she told the BBC. \nPankaj Jain, the man behind verification site SM Hoax slayer, knows this better than most. He told the BBC that his inspiration to bust hoaxes were the \"stupid rumours\" he kept receiving on WhatsApp. \n\"I began by responding to messages to tell people what they were passing on was not true, and then decided to take it further.\"\nHe came to prominence after becoming one of the first people to shoot down a viral news story which claimed that India\'s new 2,000 rupee note was embedded with a \"nano GPS chip\" that allowed authorities to track it if it was taken outside the country.\n \"I did a lot of research and the thing that jumped out at me the most was that nano-GPS chips need a power source to function, which the new currency note very clearly did not have,\" he said.\nHis other notable \"busts\" include  proving that a photograph tweeted out by a leading news channel purporting to be of two \"terrorists\" killed in Indian-administered Kashmir was actually a two-year-old photograph from Punjab, and more recently, explaining that a viral WhatsApp forward of the Indian flag flying atop the Israeli parliament only happened on Photoshop.\nShammas Oliyath, who runs the verification site Check4spam.com is another \"warrior\" in the battle against fake news.\nHis content is divided into several categories such as \"internet rumours\" and \"promotions\", but he says most of the news he deals with tends to be politically related.  \nHe gets about 200 WhatsApp inquiries a day, a number that has picked up after he got a little publicity for forcing a media organisation to retract a story which claimed that the assets of wanted Indian gangster Dawood Ibrahim had been frozen. \nDespite their best efforts however, all three men know that they simply cannot take on the exploding fake news system on their own. \nMr Sinha says Altnews has done roughly 3.2 million pageviews in five months, while SM Hoaxslayer gets about 250,000 pageviews a month. Mr Oliyath says Check4spam.com gets about 15,000 hits a day.\nThese numbers pale in comparison to mainstream media sites, and hardly make a dent in the hundreds of thousands of messages that get passed around every day. \nMr Oliyath rues the fact that India\'s mainstream media is a part of the problem.  \n\"In the rush to report first, there is no focus on fact checking,\" he says. \nMs Raghunath agrees.\n \"Television in this country has always been tabloid and not serious. The state operated Doordarshan never took off, and the rest was always tabloid - which is to say, talking heads and live news reel,\" she said, adding that there is very little emphasis on process even in India\'s digital news ecosystem.\nWhat this means is that, a lot of the time, social and mainstream media feed off one another, fuelled by the desire for more eyeballs. \nHowever, she says the larger issue is still one of media literacy and believes that the fight against fake news still needs to be led by mainstream legacy media.\n\"People segment organisations into those they trust and those that they believe are there to entertain them.

Between 1962 and 1989, elections were completed in four to 10 days. The four-day elections in 1980 were the country\'s shortest ever.\nElections in India are long-drawn-out affairs because of the need to secure polling stations.\nLocal police are seen to be partisan, so federal forces have to deployed. The forces have to be freed from their duties and moved all around the country. \nIndia\'s Centre for Media Studies estimated parties and candidates spent some $5bn (£3.8bn) for the 2014 elections. \"It is not inconceivable that overall expenditure will double this year,\" says Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the US-based think-tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nCompare it to the $6.5bn that the US spent on the famously free-spending presidential and congressional elections in 2016, and you realise how costly India\'s elections are.\nFinancing of political parties in India continues to be opaque despite the fact that they are forced to declare their incomes.\nLast year, Mr Modi\'s government launched electoral bonds, which allow businesses and individuals to donate to parties without their identities being disclosed.\nDonors have given away nearly $150m in these bonds - and the bulk of it, according to reports, has gone to the BJP.\nIndian women are voting in large numbers. So much so, that more women are likely to vote than men this time around, the first time ever in a general election.\nThe vote gender gap has already shrunk - in 2014, the turnout of women was 65.3% against 67.1% for men.\nIn more than two dozen local elections between 2012 and 2018, the turnout of women was higher than men in two-thirds of the states.\nPolitical parties have begun treating women as a constituency and offering them more sops: education loans, free cooking gas cylinders, cycles for girls.\nIn 2014, Mr Modi led his BJP and its allies to a historic victory.  \nThe BJP alone won 282 of the 428 seats it contested. It was the first time since 1984 a party had won an absolute majority in a general election. The BJP also picked up a third of the popular vote.\nThe staggering win was largely attributed to Mr Modi\'s ability to promote himself as a decisive, hardworking leader who promised to usher in corruption-free \"better times\". \nDespite a patchy performance on several of his promises, Mr Modi remains his party\'s main vote-getter. He\'s also supported by a formidable and disciplined party machinery, run by his trusted and powerful aide Amit Shah.\nAnalysts believe the summer elections will largely be a referendum on Mr Modi. \nThe opposition campaign will be entirely targeted at the prime minister, a polarising leader who is loved and loathed in equal measure.\nSo expect a presidential-style faceoff in a parliamentary election. Whether Mr Modi remains a durable brand will be known when the votes are counted.\nCan the 133-year-old Congress party step back from the abyss?\nIn 2014, the party suffered its worst defeat ever in a general election. It won a mere 44 seats - down from 206 seats - and  picked up less than 20% of the popular vote.\nThings remained bleak as the party lost a string of state elections over the next four years. By the middle of 2018, the Congress and its allies ran only three state governments, while BJP and its partners ran as many as 20.\nThe party appeared to be in terminal decline. Its leader Rahul Gandhi, fourth generation scion of the famous Nehru-Gandhi family, became the butt of social media jokes.\nBut in December, the party seemed to seemed to have staged a revival of sorts.\nLed by a more assured and energetic Mr Gandhi, the Congress wrested three key northern states from the BJP.  Many attributed the recovery to anti-incumbency - two of the three states had been ruled by the BJP for years. But it would be churlish to deny Mr Gandhi and his party workers credit.\nClearly, Congress has got some of its old mojo back. Mr Gandhi has positioned himself as a more open and receptive leader in contrast to the forceful and take-no-prisoners leadership style of Mr Modi. And in a surprise move, his charismatic sister Priyanka has been formally inducted into politics to infuse some fresh energy into the party\'s campaign.Congress\'s revival has helped rejuvenate a fractured opposition, and promises to make the 2019 election more of a contest than what was believed it would be.\nUnder Mr Modi, Asia\'s third-largest economy appears to have lost some of its momentum.\nFarm incomes have stagnated because of a crop glut and declining commodity prices, leaving farmers saddled with debt and angry.\nThe controversial 2016 currency ban - locally called \'demonetisation\' - and a complex and badly executed new uniform goods and services tax hurt small and medium businesses and threw many out of their jobs in India\'s huge informal economy. \nExports have dropped. Joblessness has risen, and Mr Modi\'s government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data. To make matters worse, some of India\'s state-owned banks are drowning in bad loans.\nYet, inflation is in check. Increased government spending in infrastructure and public works has kept the economy moving. Growth is expected to be 6.8% this fiscal year.\nBut the fact is that India\'s GDP needs to grow at a rate faster than 7% for the country to continue to pull millions out of poverty.\nMr Modi has said reforming the economy is a work in progress. The elections will prove whether people are willing to give him more time. \nEconomist Rathin Roy says India is moving from a \"development state to a compensatory state\" where governments are putting cash in the pockets of the poor to cover up for the deficiencies of the state.\nThe result is competitive populism. \nMr Modi\'s government has announced direct cash transfers to farmers and waivers of farm loans. It has also promised job quotas for the less well-to-do among the upper castes and other religions. \nRahul Gandhi has promised to guarantee a minimum income for the poor if his party wins the elections. Others will be showering the voters with freebies ranging from TV sets to laptops. There is no clear evidence to show that sops win votes. \nMr Modi\'s muscular nationalism and his party\'s majoritarian politics have left India a deeply divided and anxious nation, say critics.\nBut his supporters say it has energised and consolidated his base. They believe there\'s no need to be apologetic about political Hinduism because India, well, is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation. \nUnfortunately the nationalist rhetoric has emboldened radical rightwing groups to lynch Muslims suspected of smuggling cows. Hindus consider the cow sacred. Thanks to aggressive enforcement of anti-slaughter laws, the cow has become a polarising animal.\nPeople critical of radical Hinduism have been labelled anti-nationals. Dissent is frowned upon. \nIndia\'s 170 million Muslims, many say, have become the \"invisible\" minority. The BJP has no Muslim MPs in the lower house - it fielded seven candidates in 2014 and all of them lost.\nThe tit-for-tat aerial bombings by India and Pakistan at the end of February following a deadly suicide attack in Indian-administered Kashmir triggered more nationalistic chest thumping. \nMr Modi has made it clear he would not hesitate to retaliate if there was another attack on Indian soil provoked or sponsored by Pakistan-based militant groups.\nWhat is clear now is that Mr Modi will make national security a key plank of his campaign. Whether this will work is not clear. The opposition has to still come up with a persuasive counter-narrative. Will the pull of nationalism override other issues and fetch swing votes for Mr Modi?  \nThe northern state of Uttar Pradesh has an outsize influence on Indian politics. \nOne in six Indians lives here and it sends 80 MPs to parliament. It is also one of India\'s most socially divided states.\nThe BJP won 71 of the state\'s 80 seats in 2014. Last time, Mr Modi\'s charisma and his party\'s ability to stitch together a rainbow coalition of castes contributed to the rout of powerful regional parties, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). \nMs Mayawati, who heads the BSP, is an icon to millions of low-caste Dalits, a fifth of the state. She has now joined hands with her arch rival Akhilesh Yadav of SP, a nominally socialist party. Together they hope to win more than 50 seats and halt the BJP\'s march to Delhi.\nIt is an opportunistic alliance - bitter foes turned strange bedfellows - but could end up hurting the BJP\'s prospects in the state. It will be pinning its hopes on Mr Modi to neutralise the alliance. \nFollow Soutik at @soutikBBC', ' Modi Europe Australia Milan Vaishnav Carnegie Endowment International Peace Modi Modi Modi Amit Shah Rahul Gandhi Led Gandhi Modi Modi Economist Rathin Roy Modi Rahul Gandhi Modi Hindu Muslims Dissent Kashmir Modi Uttar Pradesh Modi Samajwadi Party Bahujan Samaj Party Dalits Delhi Follow Soutik', '10 4 2019'),
(91, 'India election 2019: Are fears of a mass hack credible?', '\nWith 800 million voters and nearly 2,000 political parties taking part, India\'s elections are a staggeringly challenging exercise. And at the heart of the credibility of these complex elections is the robustness and integrity of the vote count.\nFor decades voting was blighted by the capture of polling stations and stuffing of ballot boxes by mobs hired by political parties.\nAll this changed with the introduction of the electronic voting machines at the turn of the century. However, from time to time, doubts have been raised about the machines. Parties, usually on the losing side, have often cavalierly alleged that the machines can be hacked into and ballots rigged. \nWith national elections looming in the summer, such doubts have emerged again. Last week, India\'s election authorities rejected claims by a US-based technologist who said the machines were hacked during the 2014 general elections in which Narendra Modi\'s right-wing BJP party swept to power. \nBut credible concerns about the technology used in the machines have persisted. There have been at least seven challenges in the courts but India\'s election authorities have steadfastly defended the machines as tamper-proof. \nEach of India\'s 1.6 million voting machines record a maximum of 2,000 votes (the number of registered voters at any given polling booth does not exceed 1,500) and 64 candidates. \nThe locally-made machines  run on batteries and can be used in areas without electricity. The software was designed by a group of engineers at a state-run electronics firm, and authorities insist that the machines and their records are not accessible to anyone outside this group.\nVoters cast their ballots by pressing a button on the machine. Another button allows poll officials to stop the machine from recording more votes - this is used at the end of polling or if anybody tries to forcibly enter a polling station with the intention of casting fraudulent votes.\nTo prevent anyone tampering with the unit that holds the voting information, it is sealed with old-fashioned wax, supplemented by a secure strip from the election commission and a serial number.\nThe voting machines have so far been used in three federal and 113 state elections. \nThey save time: results from machines in a single parliamentary seat are available within three to five hours, down from 40 hours when ballots were counted manually. The machines have also eliminated \"invalid\" votes and led to huge cost savings.\nResearch has shown that the voting machines have significantly reduced electoral fraud and human error and been generally beneficial for India\'s democracy. \nUsing data from state elections, researchers Sisir Debnath, Mudit Kapoor and Shamika Ravi studied the impact of the voting machines in a 2017 research paper.\nThey found that the machines had significantly reduced electoral fraud, helped the poor and the weak to come out and vote, and made elections more competitive. They also found e-voting had led to a decline in the vote shares of incumbent parties.\nIndia\'s election authorities have steadfastly maintained that the voting machines cannot be tampered with, and physical tampering is easily detectable. From time to time, these claims have been contested. \nEight years ago, University of Michigan scientists connected a home-made device to a machine and were able to change results by sending text messages from a mobile phone. Indian authorities rubbished the claim, saying that even getting hold of machines to tamper with would very difficult.\nExperts like Dhiraj Sinha of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe that hacking tens of thousands of voting machines on a mass scale would require lots of money, involve both those who make the machines and authorities - in this case India\'s election commission - and require the use of a very small receiver circuit with an efficient antenna \"which would remain invisible to the human eye\". \nTo enable wireless hacking, he says, the machine would need to have a radio receiver containing an electronic circuit and an antenna. Authorities claim the Indian machines do not have such a circuit element. In short, carrying out a mass hack would be next to impossible. \nSome 33 countries use some form of electronic voting. The integrity of the machines has been questioned in some of them.  \nMachines used in the 2017 elections in Venezuela allegedly inflated the actual turnout by at least a million votes, a claim rejected by the government. \nArgentina\'s politicians rejected plans for e-voting in the same year, raising concerns over ballot secrecy and manipulation of results. \nA partial recount of votes was carried out in parliamentary elections in Iraq in 2018, following reports of technical glitches in electronic machines. \nLast December, e-voting machines became a source of contention in presidential elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo amid reports they had not been thoroughly tested.\nIn the US, where voting machines were introduced some 15 years ago - there is now about 35,000 of them in use - there have been concerns over machines with no back-up paper trail misreading the vote.\nMachines used to tally results and programme voting machines were found be to be carrying software allowing remote access to system administrators.\n\"My general opinion is that we should get as much technology out of the process as possible,\" Duncan Buell, a professor of computer science at the University of South Carolina who has been studying e-voting systems, told me. \n\"Software is very hard to get right, and with an intent to have votes not be identified with voters, there is no good way to verify that things have worked as intended.\" \nHowever things may be moving in the right direction in India in efforts to make elections more transparent and trustworthy. \nFive years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that all machines should be equipped with printers producing voter-verifiable paper audit trails. \nWhen a vote is cast, a paper slip is printed containing the serial number, name and symbol of the candidate and remains exposed through a transparent window for seven seconds. After this, this slip automatically gets cut and falls into a sealed drop box.\nAuthorities have decided to tally the paper trail slips and compare them with the electronic result provided by the machine in at least 5% of booths in assembly seats. And since a full manual paper trail tally could be prohibitively expensive and time consuming, researchers have offered risk-limiting audits which could provide \"high confidence in Indian election results.\"\nFor the moment, former election chief SY Quraishi believes the paper trail should put to rest all doubts in the minds of voters and political parties. \nSince 2015, all state polls have been held using paper trails. In these elections paper slips generated by some 1,500 machines were counted and tallied with the votes in the voting machines. \"There was not one mismatch,\" he said.', ' Narendra Modi Sisir Debnath Mudit Kapoor Shamika Ravi Dhiraj Sinha Massachusetts Institute Technology Venezuela Duncan Buell', '25 1 2019'),
(92, '\'War\' and India PM Modi\'s muscular strongman image', '\nA gaffe is when a politician tells the truth, American political journalist Michael Kinsley said. \nLast week, a prominent leader of India\'s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appeared to have done exactly that. BS Yeddyurappa said the armed aerial hostilities between India and Pakistan would help his party win some two dozen seats in the upcoming general election. \nThe remark by Mr Yeddyurappa, former chief minister of Karnataka, was remarkable in its candour. Not surprisingly, it was immediately seized upon by opposition parties. They said it was a brazen admission of the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party was mining the tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals ahead of general elections, which are barely a month away. Mr Modi\'s party is looking at a second term in power.\nMr Yeddyurappa\'s plain-spokenness appeared to have embarrassed even the BJP. Federal minister VK Singh issued a statement, saying the government\'s decision to carry out air strikes in Pakistan last week was to \"safeguard our nation and ensure safety of our citizens, not to win a few seats\". No political party can afford to concede that it was exploiting a near war for electoral gains. \nEven as tensions between India and Pakistan ratcheted up last week, Mr Modi went on with business as usual. Hours after the Indian attack in Pakistan\'s Balakot region, he told a packed election meeting that the country was in safe hands and would \"no longer be helpless in the face of terror\". Next morning, Pakistan retaliated and captured an Indian pilot who ejected from a downed fighter jet. Two days later, Pakistan returned the pilot to India.\nMr Modi then told a gathering of scientists that India\'s aerial strikes were merely a \"pilot project\" and hinted there was more to come. Elsewhere, his party chief Amit Shah said India had killed more than 250 militants in the Balakot attack even as senior defence officials said they didn\'t know how many had died. Gaudy BJP posters showing Mr Modi holding guns and flanked by soldiers, fighter jets and orange explosions have been put up in parts of the country. \"Really uncomfortable with pictures of soldiers on election posters and podiums. This should be banned. Surely the uniform is sullied by vote gathering in its name,\" tweeted Barkha Dutt, an Indian television journalist and author.\nMr Modi has appealed to the opposition to refrain from politicising the hostilities. The opposition parties are peeved because they believe Mr Modi has not kept his word. Last week, they issued a statement saying \"national security must transcend narrow political considerations\".  \nBut can the recent conflict fetch more votes for Mr Modi? In other words, can national security become a campaign plank?\nMany believe Mr Modi is likely to make national security the pivot of his campaign. Before last month\'s suicide attack - claimed by Pakistan-based militants - killed more than 40 Indian paramilitaries in Kashmir, Mr Modi was looking a little vulnerable. His party had lost three state elections on the trot to the Congress party. Looming farm and jobs crises were threatening to hurt the BJP\'s prospects.  \nNow, many believe, Mr Modi\'s chances look brighter as he positions himself as a \"muscular\" protector of the country\'s borders. \"This is one of the worst attempts to use war to win [an] election, and to use national security as petty political gain. But I don\'t know whether it will succeed or not,\" says Yogendra Yadav, a politician and psephologist. \nEvidence is mixed on whether national security helps ruling parties win elections in India. Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of political science at Brown University in the US, says previous national security disruptions in India were \"distant from the national elections\". \nThe wars in 1962 (against China) and 1971 (against Pakistan) broke out after general elections. Elections were still two years away when India and Pakistan fought a war in 1965.  The 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the two countries to the brink of war happened two years after a general election. The Mumbai attacks in 2008 took place five months before the elections in 2009 - and the then ruling Congress party won without making national security a campaign plank.\nThings may be different this time. Professor Varshney says the suicide attack in Kashmir on 14 February and last week\'s hostilities are \"more electorally significant than the earlier security episodes\". \nFor one, he says, it comes just weeks ahead of a general election in a highly polarised country. The vast expansion of the urban middle class means that national security has a larger constituency. And most importantly, according to Dr Varshney, \"the nature of the regime in Delhi\" is an important variable. \"Hindu nationalists have always been tougher on national security than the Congress. And with rare exceptions, national security does not dominate the horizons of regional parties, governed as they are by caste and regional identities.\"\nBhanu Joshi, a political scientist also at Brown University, believes Mr Modi\'s adoption of a muscular and robust foreign policy and his frequent international trips to meet foreign leaders may have touched a chord with a section of voters. \"During my work in northern India, people would continuously invoke the improvement in India\'s stature in the international arena. These perceptions get reinforced with an event like [the] Balakot strikes and form impressions which I think voters, particularly on a bipolar contest of India and Pakistan, care about,\" says Mr Joshi.\nOthers like Milan Vaishnav, senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, echo a similar sentiment. He told me that although foreign policy has never been a \"mass\" issue in India\'s domestic politics, \"given the proximity of the conflict to the elections, the salience of Pakistan, and the ability of the Modi government to claim credit for striking back hard, I expect it will become an important part of the campaign\".\nBut Dr Vaishnav believes it will not displace the economy and farm distress as an issue, especially in village communities. \"Where it will help the BJP most is among swing voters, especially in urban constituencies. If there were fence-sitters unsure of how to vote in 2019, this emotive issue might compel them to stick with the incumbent.\" \nHow the opposition counters Mr Modi\'s agenda-setting on national security will be interesting to watch. Even if the hostilities end up giving a slight bump to BJP prospects in the crucial bellwether states in the north, it could help take the party over the winning line. But then even a week is a long time in politics. \nFollow Soutik at @soutikBBC', ' Michael Kinsley Yeddyurappa Karnataka Narendra Modi Modi Modi Hours Modi Amit Shah Balakot Gaudy Barkha Dutt Modi Modi Kashmir Modi Yogendra Yadav Ashutosh Varshney Brown University US Delhi Bhanu Brown University Modi Milan Vaishnav Modi Modi Follow Soutik', '6 3 2019'),
(93, 'Why the humble cow is India\'s most polarising animal', '\nWhy do Indians love cows so much?\nOne of the reasons, writes historian Mukul Kesavan, is that \'for Hindus the desi cow is a beautiful thing\".\n\"Its large eyes, its calm, its matte skin tinted in a muted palette that runs from off-white to grey through beige and brown, its painterly silhouette with its signature hump, make it the most evolved of animals,\" he says.\nIt is also a sacred animal for the majority Hindu community, and they amble unmolested in traffic-choked streets. The animal is worshipped and decorated during festivals; holy men take around cows, with their foreheads smeared in vermillion, to seek alms. \nThere is even a journal called Indian Cow; and a Love 4 Cow Trust to \"propagate and promote love\" for cows. A right-wing Hindu organisation has actually launched cosmetics using cow urine and dung. \nThe cud-chewing, sedentary bovine also provides fodder for humour. A hugely popular - and possibly apocryphal - story relates to an essay on the animal by a civil service aspirant. \"The cow is a successful animal,\" it began. \"Also he is quadruped, and because he is female, he give milk, but will do so when he is got child. He is same like God, sacred to Hindus and useful to man. But he has got four legs together. Two are forward and two are afterwards.\"\nBut let\'s not digress. \nMore seriously, most states forbid cow slaughter, and the ban on beef has been criticised by many because the meat is cheaper than chicken and fish and is a staple for the poorer Muslim, tribal and dalit (formerly untouchable) communities.\nNot surprisingly, the cow is also India\'s most polarising - and political - animal. \nLast month, a 50-year-old man in northern Uttar Pradesh was killed in a mob lynching over rumours that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence over the killing nearly two weeks later, members of his party thrashed an independent lawmaker in Kashmir for hosting a beef party. \nEarlier this month, Hindus and Muslims clashed over rumours, again, of cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh. A row over banning beef is threatening to stoke religious tensions in restive Kashmir. \nWhile campaigning for his party in the crucial state elections in Bihar state, Mr Modi ridiculed a regional rival for saying many Hindus eat beef.\nThere are worrying reports that supporters of the BJP and right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the state have launched a virulent campaign against cow slaughter and beef.\nAlthough the government\'s own animal census shows that the cow and buffalo population has grown - a 6.75% increase between 2007 and 2012 -  and cow slaughter is banned in most states, there is hysteria being whipped up that the bovine is under threat. \nVigilante cow protection groups have mushroomed. They claim to have a strong network of informers and say they \"feel empowered\" because of the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP government in Delhi. One of these groups actually managed to get a court order against a beef and pork festival at a Delhi university in 2012. \nThat\'s not all. The BJP-ruled state of Rajasthan has a cow minister. There are campaigns going on demanding that the cow should replace the tiger as the national animal - a minister in Haryana, also ruled by the BJP, promptly began an online poll. \nMr Modi must partly share the blame for whipping up the unfounded and perilous frenzy over cow slaughter. On the general election campaign trail last year, he accused the Congress government of promoting a \"pink revolution\" - slaughtering cows and exporting meat for money. \"Should we feel proud of this endeavour of the UPA government led by Congress, which is founded on the killing of our mother cow?\" he wrote in a blog in 2012. It\'s another matter that under Mr Modi, India continues to be the world\'s largest exporter of beef - 80% of it buffalo meat.\nBut historian Mukul Kesavan sees one argument offered for cow protection as \"just a belligerent assertion\". \n\"It goes like this: I am a Hindu, the cow is my mother, and I won\'t have her killed. What\'s being invoked here isn\'t morality or sentimentality or chivalry or economics: this is an assertion of fictive kinship that effectively argues that all cows are Hindu women.\"\nThis is not the first time the cow has become mixed up with politics. \nThe first organised Hindu cow protection movement was launched by a Sikh sect in Punjab in about 1870. In 1882, Hindu religious leader Dayananda Saraswati founded the first cow protection committee. \"It made the animal a symbol of the unity of a wide-ranging people, challenged the Muslim practice of its slaughter and provoked a series of serious communal riots in the 1880s and 1890s,\" says historian DN Jha.\nConflicts over cow slaughter often sparked religious riots that led to the killing of more than 100 people in 1893 alone. In 1966, at least eight people died in riots outside the parliament in Delhi while demanding a national ban on cow slaughter. And in 1979, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, considered by many as a spiritual heir of Mahatma Gandhi, went on a hunger strike to ban cow slaughter.\nThe \"holiness of the cow\" is also a myth, argues Dr Jha. In his masterly work The Myth of the Holy Cow, Dr Jha cites religious scriptures and ancient texts to show that Hindus did consume beef in ancient India. This flew against the Hindu right-wing assertion that beef-eating arrived in India with the coming of Islam. (Not surprisingly, he was threatened after the book was published in India.) \nAnd American academic Wendy Doniger correctly argues that Hindus \"do not always treat cows with respect or kindness; cows are sometimes beaten and frequently half starved\".\nIndia\'s most revered leader Mahatma Gandhi may also have been responsible for the Hindu veneration of the cow. He once said that the \"central fact of Hinduism is cow protection\", and spoke about the \"idea of penance and self-sacrifice for the martyred innocence\" it embodied. Today, in an ironical twist, the Hindu radicals seem to have hijacked the cow, and all it stands for.', ' Mukul Kesavan Hindu God Hindus Muslim Uttar Pradesh Narendra Modi Kashmir Hindus Muslims Uttar Pradesh Kashmir Bihar Modi Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Hindu Delhi Delhi Rajasthan Haryana Mukul Kesavan Sikh Hindu Dayananda Saraswati Muslim Acharya Vinoba Bhave Mahatma Gandhi Hindus Islam Wendy Doniger Hindus Mahatma Gandhi Hindu', '15 10 2015'),
(94, 'Does the Kumbh Mela experience improve your well being?', '\nWhat do you make of householders turned austere pilgrims who live in tatty canvas tents on a flood plain of a river braving regular baths in freezing water, biting cold, smoky skies and ear-splitting din for more than a month?\nMost of them come from villages, are elderly, and belong to the higher castes. Many are worldly people turned ascetics eking out spartan lives as kalpavasis (those who spend their days in silent prayer) at the ongoing Kumbh Mela, the biggest religious gathering in the world. \nOrdinary folks like us would want to believe that the suffering that ascetics undergo in order to toughen themselves up will in fact have deleterious effects on their wellbeing and health.  \nNot so if you believe recent research on \"pilgrim experiences\" by academics and researchers from nine universities in India and UK. They carried out two surveys involving over 400 kalpavasis during the festivals in 2010 and 2011, an event which even the researchers called an \"ordeal\". \nTens of millions of people - 30 million on the main bathing day on Sunday - bound by faith that a dip at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna river will get rid of their sins - throng the event. Dust, smoke and the ear-shattering noise levels can make matters worse.  \nStill the pilgrims describe the Mela as \"serene and blissful\". When researchers played them 20-second clips that contained a mix of sounds recorded at different sites, including in the Mela grounds and also the streets of Allahabad city, the pilgrims could pick up the sounds of the festival and \"interpreted and experienced these noises much more positively when they believed them to be Mela-related\".\nThe research talks about the pilgrims bathing in the cold water with \"relish, serenity and silent stoicism\". Being in a big group helps them to overcome hardship - researchers call it the virtue of a \"social security net\". \nIt\'s also a shining example of the \"power of the collective over the individual\". Ergo, when a group of people deals with hardship together, the weakest of individuals can display remarkable feats of endurance.\nThe Kumbh Mela is a stunning example of the power of faith. Last Sunday, I witnessed millions of bedraggled men, women and children, young and old, on their way to a holy bath trudging towards the river silently carrying their bare belongings in  sacks and cheap rexine bags. \nFar removed from the excesses of the shiny gurus and their rich devotees, these ordinary pilgrims make the Kumbh Mela a truly extraordinary event of faith. And faith can apparently move mountains.\nI asked Dr Nick Hopkins of Dundee University, one of the lead researchers, about what surprised them about the findings. \n\"Typically\", he said, \"people assume that crowds - especially noisy crowds - are stressors that must detract from one\'s well being.\"\nBut strikingly, the pilgrims at the Mela told the researchers that they \"feel good ... actually, more than good ... their language verges on the ecstatic\". \nFrench sociologist Emile Durkheim famously coined the word effervescence to describe the fizzy excitement of crowds. Many believe anand (joy), the word used by pilgrims to describe the experience, is closer to effervescence, especially as Durkehim was studying religious experiences.\nBut what about that assumption that crowds are generally considered bad for one\'s health? A young British devotee told me at the Mela that coming to the event was a massive leap of faith for her as she thought it would not be \"safe\" for her health. Years ago, the medical journal The Lancet ran a series of pieces on why mass gatherings are bad for health.\nBut the research at the Kumbh Mela found that the event \"actually increases peoples\' mental and physical well-being\", showing the \"importance of networks and groups in sustaining our health\".

(97, 'Kumbh Mela festival', '\nIndia\'s Kumbh Mela festival is usually described as the world\'s biggest gathering.\nDriven by a belief that a dip at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers on auspicious days will cleanse sins and help bring salvation, millions of Hindus come to the festival in the city of Allahabad every 12 years. \nOfficials in charge of the festival say eight million people took to the waters on Monday, when the 55-day festival opened. The official turnout on the opening day of the festival in Allahabad during the 2001 festival was 2.5 million.\nBut the turnout of pilgrims on Monday, put out by the civilian administration, is sharply different from the estimate of the festival\'s top police official, Alok Sharma. \nThe festival is managed by thousands of state officials led jointly by a magistrate in charge of the civilian administration and a senior police officer in charge of troops. \n\"According to my estimate, there were only 1.5 to 1.8 million people on the opening day,\" says Mr Sharma. \nHe should know: he was in charge of the 2001 Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, and the 1998 and 2010 festivals in Haridwar too. He not only has experience on his side, but also help from rough counts that some of the 8,500 policemen under his charge are tasked to do. \nMr Sharma says his men follow two methods to count crowds at the festival on auspicious days. The count is aimed at estimating the number of people coming into Allahabad to help maintain law and order.\nOne method involves counting people using the seven major roads leading into Allahabad, assuming that everyone is heading for the Kumbh Mela. \nA 10-metre stretch is marked on each of these seven roads, and the number of people passing through each stretch every minute is counted. \nMr Sharma says logistical difficulties mean that police cannot count people coming along the lanes and by-lanes of the city which, he reckons, \"accounts for about 30% of traffic\" at the festival. \nThe second method - essentially cross-checking the numbers thrown up by the first method - involves counting people after they have poured into the heavily-guarded festival ground.\n\"There are three main roads from Allahabad city into the festival ground and we follow the same counting method,\" says Mr Sharma. \nPilgrims using the pontoon bridges over the Ganges to come to the festival were not counted on the opening day, he adds. \nCombining the two methods and the number of people who got off trains at the Allahabad railway station led Mr Sharma to come up with an estimate of 1.5 to 1.8 million people at the festival on Monday.\n\"A real count is very, very difficult. And there is a tendency to increase the estimate,\" says Mr Sharma.\nLive updates\nPreparing for millions\nIs there any way of counting a close-to-precise number of people at such festivals? \n\"At the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar (another north Indian city where the Kumbh also happens) in 2010, we tried satellite imagery to count. That gave us a combined figure of 16 million pilgrims for the two busiest days of the festival. But it didn\'t look like a very realistic figure. I was not impressed by it,\" says Mr Sharma.\nWhat was the difference between the satellite-fed number and Mr Sharma\'s \"manual\" calculation? \n\"Just half or eight million,\" he said, hinting at the possibility of a huge margin of error.\nSo who put out the official count of a gathering of eight million people at the festival on Monday? \nHari Narayan Singh, an assistant superintendent of police, was in the control room that oversees the running of the festival that day. He kept in touch with observation towers near the bathing area throughout the day. \nHis last count of the day, at 19:00 India time [13:30GMT], was eight million, which he relayed to higher authorities, who informed the media. \nHow did Mr Singh\'s colleagues count? \n\"We first estimate, visually, the number of people going in and out of the water every minute. Then we calculate for the hour and add up for the day. I was here at 2001 too, and we have an idea from those figures too,\" he said.\nSo there\'s really no way of ensuring that wild miscalculations don\'t take place? \n\"No, there\'s no real science to it,\" said Mr Singh.\nSix years ago on the opening day of the Ardh Kumbh festival - an Ardh (or half) Kumbh is held every six years - in Allahabad I had asked the senior-most police officer for his estimate of the gathering. \nHe had thrown back the question casually: \"How many do you think are here?\" \nTaken aback, I had mumbled that it could be three million or so. \n\"That\'s good, I\'ll go with it,\" he had said. \nThe figure came back to me through reports.

(98, 'Kumbh Mela: India\'s Hindu Naga nuns get their own space', '\nFor the first time, women ascetics from the elite Hindu Naga - meaning naked - holy order have won the right to have their own separate camp at the Kumbh Mela, the world\'s largest gathering, in Allahabad, India. Amitava Sanyal reports from Allahabad. \nCalled the Juna Sannyasini Akhara, or the Juna Nuns\' Order, the women religious have their own distinguishing pennant, an anointed leader and a separate enclosure at the Kumbh Mela. \nThe new order is from among the Naga monks, who control the religious affairs at the world\'s biggest gathering and have the right to remain naked. (Naga is derived from the Sanskrit for naked, \"nagna\", and is different from the Naga tribes of north-eastern India.)\nThe Naga order is a highly secretive and closed group. Its initiation and rites are not divulged to the public.\nEarlier, the few women among this overwhelmingly male world of the Hindu holy orders were organised under various men\'s camps at the Kumbh, which is a festival held every 12 years and whose recorded history stretches back at least 1,000 years. \nThe women had to defer to the men for leadership and received inferior treatment in terms of basic amenities at the festival.  \nNow, they have their own leader, are given more space and resources and have access to separate toilets; entry to the women\'s enclosure is strictly monitored by the police. \n\"We are still coming to terms with the new markers of identity,\" says Devya Giri, leader of the women\'s order. \nThe 35-year-old, who earned a post-graduate degree as a medical technician from the Institute of Public Health and Hygiene in Delhi before being ordained in 2004, adds with a hint of subversion: \"We are thinking of doing some things differently. For one, though the presiding deity of the Juna Order for men is Dattatreya, (a three-faced minor god) we are thinking of incorporating Dattatreya\'s mother Anusuya as our presiding deity.\" \nSorting out gods is one thing - fixing gender issues on Earth is quite another.\nRecently Corinne \"Coco\" Leyre, from France, was initiated as a monk of the women\'s order in a secret ceremony. \n\"Things are not equal between the men and women\'s orders yet. We still have to depend on the men for the big decisions, like when our tents will be put up,\" says the soft-spoken, saffron-clad 45-year-old. \nMs Leyre, who took the monastic name of Sangam Giri, was the first initiate who chose all her gurus - a Naga monk has five gurus that he or she can choose - from among women.\n\"These women have grown up depending on their fathers, husbands or sons all their lives. They often wait for things to happen to them, which we in the West are not used to,\" Nicole Jaquis, a filmmaker from New York who has known the nuns since 2001 and who acts as a liaison officer for some of them, tells me.\nMore than three-fourths of the women at the Juna Sannyasini Akhara hail from Nepal, where widows from the upper castes are encouraged not to remarry. \nRather than going back to their parents, a large number of them turn to asceticism. \nThere is another unmistakable gender-defined difference within the Naga orders. \nUnlike the monks, the nuns are asked not to be seen naked in public, though these ones have the right to do so.\nPrahlad Giri, 70, recalls that in all her years as a Naga nun, she has seen only one woman, Brahma Giri, who used to stay naked at all times and, as a mark of defiance, kept \"two silver swords by her side\". \nBrahma Giri has passed away and now no one is allowed to stay naked, especially on the all-important auspicious bathing days at the Kumbh Mela. \nA day before the first big dip, someone from the Juna men\'s order asked Devya Giri to ensure there were no naked bathers among the nuns. \nSo unlike most of the men, the women take to the waters wrapped in a single piece of unstitched cloth.\n\"How can we allow it? It\'s not in Indian tradition to allow women to stay naked. It would bring on us a curse if we did,\" says Hari Giri, secretary general of the Juna order. \nHe says he worked towards granting the women their own pennant because \"this is a democracy and the women had been asking for it for a long time\".

(99, 'A day at the Kumbh Mela festival', '\nMonday marks the opening day of the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela in the northern Indian city of Allahabad.\nTens of millions of pilgrims are expected to visit to bathe at the Sangam - the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers.  The festival is scheduled to continue until 10 March and is billed as the biggest religious gathering in the world.\nThe festival has been held on the banks of the Ganges for thousands of years. It is at its largest once every 12 years when it attracts tens of millions of people.\nThe BBC\'s Geeta Pandey is in Allahabad, and has been giving regular updates on how the day progressed.\nAs the sun begins to set on Allahabad on a day that millions of Hindus believe to be very special, I head back to Sangam to meet the last few bathers. \nMonica Vaish, a young high court lawyer from the city, is returning after a dip in the river with her extended family. \n\"I came here because my mother said I must have a bath now because this Kumbh is special. This Maha Kumbh is coming after 144 years. She said it won\'t happen again in my lifetime.\"\nBut Ms Vaish is unhappy with the quality of the river water. \"It\'s very dirty. It was smelly. I\'ll have to have another bath once I get home,\" she says.\nBefore I set out for Allahabad, my cook Purnima asked me to get her a bottle of Ganges water. She is a devout Hindu who believes in the sanctity of India\'s pilgrimage centres and holy rivers. \nAt the river bank, where the pilgrims were bathing, the water appeared exceedingly muddy so I decided to hire a boat and went mid-stream in search of cleaner water.  \nFrom my boat, I could still see hundreds of pilgrims immersing themselves in the river, praying and imbibing a few drops of its water. For the faithful, Ganges is sacred and even if its water is polluted, it is still to be accepted as the blessings of the river goddess.\nThe volunteers at the lost and found camp at the Kumbh Mela have had a busy morning. \nThey have made non-stop announcements about lost people - and where they can be found - since I arrived at the grounds soon after 04:00 IST (22:30 GMT). \nBy mid-day, at Raja Ram Tiwari\'s Khoya Paya Shivir (Lost and Found Camp), some 4,300 lost people have turned up. \nThe octogenarian has an impressive record of reuniting people who get lost at the Kumbh Mela - he set up his first camp in 1946 and has covered five Maha Kumbh festivals (which fall once in 12 years), six half-Kumbh and 56 Magh melas that are held every January.\nSo far, he has helped reunite more than one million lost adults and 20,000 children with their families.\nOn Monday, he has 50 volunteers working for Bharat Seva Dal, his non-governmental organisation, scouring the grounds for anyone who looks lost, bringing them to the camp and making announcements. \n\"We have managed to reunite most of the lost people with their families, but we still have about 150 people waiting,\" says Mr Tiwari\'s son, Umesh Tiwari, who is taking over the running of the camp from his father.\nHe says that it\'s mostly the women or the elderly who get separated from their families during the bathing.\nAt the camp, I met Ram Lal who has made several announcements for his missing wife, Raj Kumari.\n\"We went for a bath and in the crowd, we got separated. I couldn\'t find her. I\'ve been waiting here for several hours, we\'ve made announcements for her, but there\'s no sign of her. I hope she\'s alright,\" he says anxiously.\nThe crowd management at the river front so far has been impressive. \nAs soon as pilgrims finish bathing, they are encouraged to move away and make space for other bathers. \nA group of 100 pilgrims from Udaipur in Rajasthan tell me that although the Sangam was very crowded, \"we had a good bath\". \nA little away from the river front, the mela area is bustling with small roadside vendors selling tea, sweets, colourful photographs of Hindu deities and small round white candies generally offered at the temple altar. \nOn one street, several toddlers dressed as Hindu deities sit by the roadside as many passing pilgrims hand them coins. \n\"Their parents are very clever,\" an old man tells me, \"for who can refuse alms to a pretty child dressed as a god or goddess?\"\nAs waves of naked ash-smeared ascetics continue to arrive and sprint towards the river, thousands of bathers in nearby enclosures watch in awe. \nOne sadhu, with long matted hair, stops and does a joyous jig for the furiously clicking cameras. \nIn a departure from tradition, a large number of women ascetics have also come for a bath at Sangam. Dressed in bright saffron-coloured saris and robes, they seemed to be enjoying all the attention. Some laughed and chatted amongst themselves, some even posed for pictures. \nMeanwhile, in the next enclosure, thousands of ordinary pilgrims - men and women, old and young - are moving in orderly lines for their bathing rituals. \nDeemaan Singh of Gwalior says he will come at least two more times before the 55-day Kumbh Mela is over. \nThe sadhus from the Niranjani akhara (camp) arrive in a huge procession.\nThe group, which has several hundred naked ascetics, has a reputation for being rather unfriendly and they are accompanied by the elite commandos of the RAF (rapid action force). The pesky journalists are reined in behind police lines \"for your own protection,\" we are told. \nThe group gets 45 minutes to bathe after which they are escorted out by the RAF troops. \nThe first group of Naga sadhus (ascetics) arrived in a colourful procession. Led by naked ash-smeared men with marigold garlands around their necks, they sprinted into the chilly waters of Sangam. \nDip over, some came and stood before us in the media enclosure, rubbing coarse river sand onto their bodies. \nI asked an old sadhu if he felt the cold. \"Not at all,\" he said and handed me some sand: \"Try it for yourself!\"\nAt 5am, Sangam is a hub of frantic activity. Thousands of pilgrims have already taken a dip in the holy waters, thousands are lining up for their turn and thousands more are walking towards the river front. \nAlthough the sky is still dark, the bathing ghats are lit up with thousands of electric bulbs. \nThe air here smells smoky from all the fires which people have burned overnight to stay warm. \nAmong the early bathers was Manidatt Panda from Nepal. \"I\'ve washed off my sins,\" he said, laughing.

(100, 'India gay sex ruling: \'It is a huge setback\'', '\nIndia\'s Supreme Court has upheld a law which criminalises gay sex, in a ruling seen as a major blow to gay rights. The court ruling reverses a landmark 2009 Delhi High Court order which had decriminalised homosexual acts. \nAccording to Section 377, a 153-year-old colonial-era law, a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\" and punishable by a 10-year jail term. Here is a cross-section of views from India on the Supreme Court order.\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the moral values of India. Laws are made to protect what is \"right\" and that is what the court has done today. \nMany consensual relationships of this unnatural nature have existed in India for decades, but that does not justify giving them legal or constitutional sanctity. \nThis is an unnatural phenomenon and it is correct to criminalise it. \nWe are living in India, this is not America, and according to the morals of our society, this is a correct judgement. \nThe Supreme Court has understood the feelings of the majority populace of the country and delivered its order accordingly.\nThe Supreme Court\'s decision is a huge embarrassment. It is supporting patriarchal and religious forces instead of siding with constitutional reason. \nIt is a setback to all minorities in the country. \nIn a modern democracy, we expect the Supreme Court to protect the rights of the marginalised and underprivileged, whether they are women, children, poor or sexual minorities. \nHow we live our personal lives, within the four walls of our house, should not be subjected to any moral policing or any mob rule. \nWe cannot accept the narrow beliefs, understandings and diktats of religious groups to dictate the laws of our country.\nWhat if tomorrow religious groups decide that inter-caste or inter-religious marriages are against the moral values of our society, then would the court make, amend or uphold laws accordingly? \nThis is setting a very bad precedent.\nHomosexuality is against the rule of nature. Gays should not be given any kind of support. They want something that is illegal to gain legitimacy but that is not acceptable. They should be banned. \nThey are trying to spread filth in the society, but you cannot allow anyone to do anything in the name of modernity.\nHomosexuality is a Western import - we have assimilated some good aspects of their culture but this is a bad aspect of their culture. We cannot ape the West blindly, otherwise how will we protect our culture?\nThe Supreme Court order is very good - it will go a long way in maintaining the rule of nature and protect Indian culture and tradition.\nThe new generation is very liberal, and so am I, but I do not approve of homosexuals polluting our society. There has to be a limit.\nI am a member of Voices Against 377 which is a coalition of LGBT [lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people], women and human rights activists.\nOur Constitution guarantees equality and it is the duty of the court to protect this, but in this judgement the Supreme Court has done exactly the opposite. \nBy taking back this legal status, the court has in a way said that because of the different identity of some citizens, their rights might be violated. \nAs the world moves to more equal rights for the transgender community, this judgement comes as a setback in the Indian context. \nHowever, the movement is much stronger now than it was when the petition to decriminalise homosexuality was originally filed in the year 2001. \nWe never thought that this fight for equal rights would be an easy one and our movement will continue with equal fervour.\nI welcome the Supreme Court order, it is a correct judgement, it\'s good for our society. In the name of people\'s rights, we cannot accept everything.\nThe court order does not violate anyone\'s rights.

(102, 'Why did India wake up so late to a child rape and murder?', '\nA bright looking eight-year old girl belonging to a Muslim nomadic tribe in Indian-administered Kashmir goes missing in the new year. \nOn 17 January, her battered body is recovered from a forest in Kathua district. Through February, police arrest eight men, including a retired government official, four policemen and a juvenile, in connection with the gang rape and murder of the girl.\nThere are protests in the summer capital, Srinagar, demanding a special probe into the incident. The crime exposed the fault lines between the Hindu-majority Jammu and the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in a sharply divided state. The incident is covered promptly and prominently by the local media in the Muslim-dominated valley.\nSo why does this story from Kathua make it to national news networks only in mid-April? Why does it evoke delayed outrage and anger? Why does this happen only after Hindu right-wing groups protest the arrest of the accused, who also belong to a Hindu community?\nWhy are the eventual protests in Delhi - including a midnight march by chief opposition leader Rahul Gandhi - milder than the ones after a similarly brutal gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi in 2012? \nThe responses tell us something about modern India.\nThe media in Delhi, many believe, exerts a disproportionate and undeserved influence over shaping the \"national narrative\". And large sections of this media have been partisan and selective when it comes to reporting on Kashmir, one of the world\'s most heavily militarised regions. \nIndia and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir and there\'s been an armed revolt in the region against Indian rule since 1989. \"The biggest problem in Kashmir is the way the place has been covered in the mainland Indian media,\" wrote senior journalist and editor of The Print, Shekhar Gupta, in 2015. \"The problem has always been very closely linked to national security and military security.\" \nSo, often, the truth (about Kashmir), he wrote, \"was considered against national security\". \nIn this instance, one could possibly cite \"religious honour\" as another reason for why most national media avoided reporting on the crime. The support shown to the accused by Hindu right wing-groups - and two ministers from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - has shocked many. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi only broke his silence on Friday evening with a series of tweets, saying \"no culprit will be spared... our daughters will definitely get justice\".\nA journalist who has been covering the incident in Kathua since January says that he had been telling his colleagues who work for Delhi-based news networks to report on the crime and its aftermath.\n\"When some of the reporters approached their offices in Delhi to tell them about the incident, the feeling was that the inauguration of a garden of tulips in the valley was a better story than the rape and murder of a girl,\" Sameer Yasir, an independent Srinagar-based journalist, told me. \nAccording to Mr Yasir, most of their bosses prevaricated, saying they didn\'t have enough people on the ground in Jammu, and that it was not \"such a big story\". Only one English news network has been consistently covering the story. \n\"I believe that media is almost tired of reporting violence in India. Rapes, lynching, torture is being reported all the time. It\'s almost like you have to run a torture report, like the weather report,\" says Shiv Visvanathan, a Delhi-based social scientist. \nIt is possibly all about what Dr Visvanathan calls the \"breakdown of moral imagination\" in India. Writing in The Indian Express newspaper, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a leading public intellectual, agreed, saying the Kashmir rape and murder proves \"without exaggeration, that India\'s moral compass has been completely obliterated, carpet-bombed out of existence by the very custodians of law, morality and virtue who give daily sermons on national pride\".\nIn a deeply divided society, collective action is always difficult. Outrage happens - as in this case - when graphic details of the torture inflicted on the girl stir the conscience of many. This is what happened in this case. \nMany say the equally horrific 2012 Delhi gang-rape provoked huge protests in the capital because the victim was like \"one of us\" who was attacked on the way home with her male friend after watching a Hollywood film at a cineplex. On the other hand, the girl in Kathua was a veritable vagabond, a member of a poor nomadic community, languishing bottom-most in India\'s unforgiving and cruel caste hierarchy.\n\"Everyone is complicit - we the people, media, politicians. There\'s no concept of human rights anymore. There are Hindu rights and Muslim rights. Our loyalties are now to religion, caste, groups and clubs,\" says Dr Visvanathan.\nIn this environment, say many, instant outrage and \"whataboutery\" are the two extreme emotions that violence like this provokes. The outrage waxes and wanes quickly - Dr Visvanathan calls it the \"Rip Van Winkle nature\" of outrage and indignation.\n\"Our reactions veer from silence to indifference to hysteria.

(103, 'India elections: Should Narendra Modi be worried?', '\nIndia\'s ruling Hindu nationalist BJP has accepted defeat in key state elections. So is Congress, India\'s Grand Old Party, finally back in the reckoning?  \nThe Congress has won in the states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and fell just short of an outright majority in Madhya Pradesh in a neck-and-neck finish. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated the opposition \"for their victories\", saying his party accepts \"the people\'s mandate with humility\". \nThe central states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are widely regarded as BJP strongholds. To put the results in context, India\'s main opposition party has been consistently losing state elections since it was routed in the seismic 2014 elections which brought Mr Modi to power, winning less than 20% of the popular vote and securing 44 of the 543 seats. It is currently in power in only two large states.\nThe BJP won 62 of the 65 seats in these three key states in the last parliamentary elections. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are also part of a bellwether region - the Hindi-speaking heartland of India - which gave the BJP and its allies 203 of the 225 seats that they won in 2014.\nSo the Congress\'s robust performance - it gained 163 assembly seats here since 2013 state polls - is a shot in the arm for the party. It will bolster the morale of party workers, make it more acceptable to sceptical regional allies, and boost the image of its leader Rahul Gandhi. It will also send out the significant message that Mr Modi\'s BJP is not invincible and can be defeated. All this will help Congress gain some much-needed momentum in the run-up to next year\'s crucial general elections. \nBut these state polls may be an unreliable barometer for next year\'s big elections. \nFor one, there was considerable anti-incumbency against the BJP in these states - the party was trying for a record fourth term in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. People in Rajasthan have a consistent record of voting out the incumbent after one term. \nBJP workers will take solace from the fact that the party still put up a spirited fight in two of the three states, despite the formidable odds of anti-incumbency. The contest in Madhya Pradesh proved to be a cliffhanger, with the final result only becoming clear by Wednesday morning.\nSecondly, the majority of seats in the three states witnessed bipolar contests between the BJP and the Congress. In general elections, regional parties will hold the key.  Next year much will depend on the kind of strategic regional alliances the Congress is able to stitch up and sustain in different states.  \nThirdly, one of the BJP\'s greatest strengths is having capable leaders in several states, many of whom who have completed more than one term. Hobbled by dynastic politics, the Congress has failed to groom young local leaders, depending mainly on the charisma of the Gandhi family.  \nAlso, the Congress appears to lack political imagination and has been unable to produce a powerful counter-narrative to the BJP. \n\"It seems to be counting on anti-incumbency to do the work, a complacent attitude that has made the BJP competitive in areas where it has gathered genuine discontent, against the lack of development outcome, unemployment and rural distress,\" says political scientist Gilles Verniers, who teaches at Ashoka University.\nWith its stridently Hindu nationalist ideology, the BJP now represents the political right and is the main conservative party in India. Regional parties have usurped the Congress\'s centrist politics, contributing to the party\'s sharp decline over the years. \nIt is also not clear whether the Congress has a grip on India\'s changing politics. \nIn their new book, Ideology and Identity, political scientists Pradeep K Chhibber and Rahul Verma from the University of California, argue that India \"is no longer led by a Western-oriented elite and citizens have voted into power politicians closer to their roots, politicians who represent small-town socially conservative values, in the BJP or regional parties\". This is a shift of power to a \"more conservative and vernacular elite\" which seems to have escaped the Congress. \nWhat remains abundantly clear is that the 2019 general elections will be a referendum on Mr Modi. \nIn 2014, Mr Modi swept to power in what was an overwhelming verdict for change. His critics believe he has largely frittered away that vote. They say his rhetoric has moved from the politics of hope to the politics of grievance, mostly blaming the Congress for the country\'s ills. \nThe party has also stoked renewed calls to build a temple on the flashpoint Indian religious site of Ayodhya, where a 16th Century mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. The BJP\'s stridently majoritarian politics, critics say, has fanned hate and left the country deeply divided. Some of India\'s important institutions like the federal investigation agency CBI and the central bank have been roiled by controversies, prompting many to believe that their independence has been eroded. \nA day before the results were due in fact, the central bank governor Urjit Patel, unexpectedly resigned.\nMr Modi\'s grandiose promises - especially to create more jobs and increase incomes of farmers - have begun to bite. Lack of jobs and declining farm incomes will be the deciding issues next year, although whether the farmers will vote as an \"angry bloc\" against what is now being perceived as an \"arrogant\" government will become clearer closer to the summer polls.\nBut the failure to offer an alternative narrative of hope to the people will make it difficult for the Congress and its often fractious allies to mount a credible challenge to Mr Modi, who still remains the BJP\'s star vote-catcher. \nIn the end, says Pratap Bhanu Mehta, vice-chancellor of Ashoka University, the elections don\'t feel like the \"buoyant narrative of a young nation marching into the future\".\n\"At the end of the day, these elections are about a competing narrative only in a limited sense:  A ruling dispensation full of arrogance, hubris, and willing to corrode all civil society and institutions competing with a Congress that is seen as a last defensive stance of an embattled republic.\" ', ' Rajasthan Chhattisgarh Madhya Pradesh Narendra Modi Chhattisgarh Madhya Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Rahul Gandhi Modi Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh Gandhi Gilles Verniers Ashoka University Ideology Identity Pradeep K Rahul Verma University California Modi Ayodhya Hindu Urjit Patel Modi Pratap Bhanu Mehta Ashoka University', '12 12 2018'),

(105, 'Why India\'s Narendra Modi remains star BJP vote-catcher', '\nNarendra Modi\'s Hindu nationalist BJP continues to expand its political footprint relentlessly. His party has emerged as the single-largest in the southern state of Karnataka, and has staked its claim to run what would be its 21st of India\'s 29 states.\nTwo other parties - Congress and the regional Janata Dal (Secular) - provided a last-minute twist by announcing a post-poll alliance which they say gives them a rightful claim to power. Between them they mopped up 114 seats, to the BJP\'s 104. The governor now has to take a call on who to ask to form a government. \nHowever, despite falling short of a simple majority by eight seats, Mr Modi will be more than happy with the results. Over the past year, the BJP has made unexpected inroads into India\'s remote north-east, which has 25 parliamentary seats. After drawing a blank until now in the five southern states, it has performed exceedingly well in Karnataka (population: 64 million). More than a dozen Congress ministers in the previous administration lost their seats.\nMuch of the credit should lie with Mr Modi. In a typically no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners campaign, the hard-working leader held more than 20 public meetings and effectively took on the populist regional leader and Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah, who uses only one name. Mr Modi spoke about combating corruption and boosting the economy, while fellow leaders whipped up Hindu resentment against Muslims.\nWhat the poll results again prove is that Mr Modi remains his party\'s most lucrative asset. He continues to energise the base and attract new converts. The BJP\'s brutally efficient cash-rich electioneering machine, run by Mr Modi\'s aide Amit Shah, also makes the party such a formidable opponent.\nFor Rahul Gandhi\'s Congress, the loss is a substantial setback. Mr Gandhi\'s much improved and focused campaign had revived hopes. Admittedly, his party was battling anti-incumbency - Karnataka last re-elected a party in state elections 33 years ago. But the Congress has been hollowed out in recent years by a lack of strong leadership. It has lost voters across various social constituencies at an alarming pace, and failed to offer a compelling narrative of hope to India\'s restless and ambitious young, who comprise the majority of voters. \n\"For the Congress, this loss is as dispiriting as it is debilitating. The Congress has lost its last remaining major state. Its fiscal coffers are drying up. Its cadres appear demoralised. And its allure as a potential alliance partner has taken a beating,\" Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia programme at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for Peace, told me.\nSo is Karnataka really a bellwether for India\'s 2019 general elections?\nDr Vaishnav says the rough rule of thumb is that state elections held two years or less before a national election tend to be fairly good predictors of the national results. In other words, parties that triumph in states in this period, despite some outliers, \"do enjoy a clear honeymoon effect\" with voters nationally.\nBut a year is a long time in politics. Three of the eight BJP-ruled states which accounted for 80% of the party\'s 282 seats in the 2014 landslide election are facing anti-incumbency and will go to the polls at the end of this year. \nA credible performance by the Congress in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan will help boost its flagging morale. But what Tuesday\'s results also show is that only a united opposition can take on Mr Modi, and Mr Gandhi has a lot of work to do to take on his formidable adversary. A rag-tag opposition coalition without a charismatic leader will not be enough to defeat the BJP.\nAlso, while Mr Modi remains popular, his government\'s indifferent economic performance has led many to believe that he has squandered the massive mandate he was given in 2014. Right-wing vigilantism is thriving, and many believe that Mr Modi and other BJP leaders haven\'t done enough to rein in the mobs.\nMany of his ministers and chief ministers are embarrassingly gaffe prone. Two allies appear to be unhappy with the BJP\'s \"arrogant\" leadership style. The BJP won by a whisker in his native state of Gujarat earlier this year.

(106, 'Narendra Modi v Imran Khan: Who won the war of perception?', '\nWith the release of the Indian pilot captured by Pakistan, tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries over the attack in Kashmir are expected to abate. So who won the battle of perception during the crisis?\nOn Thursday afternoon Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced in parliament that Pakistan would release the captured Indian pilot as a \"peace gesture\". \nIn Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was addressing a meeting of scientists. Moments after Mr Khan\'s remarks, he responded with a sarcastic broadside against Pakistan, saying that a \"pilot project had been completed\" and \"now we have to make it real\".  While his supporters cheered, others found the remark cocky and tasteless. \nOn Tuesday, hours after Indian fighter jets entered Pakistani territory and bombed an alleged terrorist training camp, Mr Modi had opened a packed campaign rally - crucial general elections are barely a month away - with a bravado-laced flourish. \"I want to assure you that the country is in safe hands,\" he told the meeting, to deafening applause.\nLess than 24 hours later, Pakistan struck back, shooting down an Indian fighter jet in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and capturing pilot Abhinandan Varthaman.  \nWhile both sides were under immense pressure to calm tensions, Mr Khan reached out and offered to release the pilot. Former Indian diplomat and strategic affairs expert KC Singh remarked that hawks in Mr Modi\'s BJP and the Indian establishment \"will be stranded by Imran Khan\'s diplomatic reverse swing\". (A reverse swing in cricket is the art of swinging the ball when it turns in towards the batsman rather than moving away from him. Mr Khan was one of the world\'s finest cricketers in his sporting days.)\nSince he swept to power in 2014, Mr Modi has retained a vice-like grip over the narrative. Helping him is a largely obsequious local media, which faithfully boosts his image of a muscular nationalist. So, many wondered why Mr Modi had chosen his bureaucrats and military to do the talking to the media and not addressed the people himself at a time when the country was on a knife-edge and awash with rumours of an imminent war with a nuclear-armed neighbour. \nAmong those miffed were India\'s main opposition parties. Twenty-one of them criticised Mr Modi for continuing to attend election meetings and political events and even launch a mobile app during, what was arguably, the biggest security crisis of his tenure. \nMany believe that Pakistan had blindsided Mr Modi with a quick and brazen retaliatory attack in which it brought down an Indian fighter jet and captured the pilot. Over the next two days Mr Khan called for de-escalation of hostilities, talked about peace and announced that the pilot would be freed. KC Singh says the Pakistani prime minister portrayed a picture of \"dignified moderation and readiness to settle differences through talks\" and took everyone by surprise with his decision to send back the Indian pilot. \nMr Khan spoke to his people and defence officials kept the media updated regularly. The prime minister, many analysts in India say, came across looking as a \"reasonable leader\" by not trying to corner India, and allowing an exit route for cessation of hostilities. \nMr Modi appeared to lose control of the narrative. \"Any which way you spin it, Pakistan\'s attack took India by surprise,\" says Srinath Raghavan, historian and author, most recently of Fierce Enigmas: A History of the United States in South Asia.\nConsider this. India struck Pakistan in the middle of the night in what was a retaliatory action for the attack in Pulwama on 14 February in which more than 40 Indian troops were killed. Pakistan\'s response was swift and audacious, striking India in broad daylight the next day. \nThe capture of the pilot meant that the narrative and expectations of Mr Modi and his government were thrown off kilter and the upbeat narrative of the morning before had now completely changed to bringing the pilot home. The Indian military briefing came more than 30 hours after the Pakistani attack. Mr Modi and his government had clearly little headroom to control the narrative.\nIn the end, trying to control the narrative through bravado can easily backfire. Mr Modi is not the first prime minister to face a security situation provoked by Pakistan-based terror groups: his predecessors Atal Behari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh faced similar provocations from across the border and had similar capabilities to strike back, but took calculated decisions to lower the temperature. \"Revenge cannot be a strategic objective. Any strategy driven by emotions is likely to fail,\" says Mr Raghavan. \nLarge parts of the press at home have spun the freeing of the Indian pilot as Mr Modi\'s victory. Very few people are asking questions about the massive intelligence failure that led to the attack in Pulwama, and how Pakistan could penetrate air defences in broad daylight. \nIndia\'s military has not even achieved its strategic aim to establish a new normal in which it would deter Pakistan-backed terrorism in India with the threat of automatic military strikes, says Ajai Shukla, a leading defence analyst. \n\"So far, Pakistan has demonstrated it can match India, and this requires the Indian military to escalate the punishment to a level that Pakistan cannot match. However, decades of neglect and under-funding have hollowed out India\'s military to the point where Mr Modi cannot rely on its capability to punish Pakistan swiftly and relatively bloodlessly,\" he says.\nAlso details of the extent of damage inflicted on the alleged terrorist camp in Pakistan by the Indian jets is still unclear. Indian authorities are not clear how many people died in the raid, although sections of the media have freely reported some 300 militants had been killed. By all accounts, Mr Modi should be staring at hard questions and fearing that he\'s lost the narrative.\nBut it may not be so. Many believe Mr Khan may have won the battle of perception with his domestic constituency and some Indians at home, but Mr Modi will continue to control the narrative with his base in India. \n\"It\'s a larger constituency than the people who do not believe Mr Modi. With a near-complete control over the media narrative, I do not really see him losing the battle of perception. His supporters will believe that while Mr Modi went about his business as usual, Mr Khan was forced to speak up and release the pilot under pressure,\" says Santosh Desai, columnist and author, most recently, of Mother Pious Lady - Making Sense of Everyday India. \nWhoever has won the battle of perceptions, there in one silver lining in this sorry saga. According to Vipin Narang, professor of political science at MIT, neither side seems to want a war. He believes that they \"have had their Cuban Missile Crisis moment and recognise how a couple of wrong turns could set off uncontrollable escalation\". \nSo both sides could get back to business. \"Pakistan could finally crack down on terrorism and avoid getting the music started.

He is the author, most recently, of Reimagining Pakistan: Transforming a Dysfunctional Nuclear State. \nAfter Tuesday\'s air strikes by India targeting militants in Pakistani territory, Pakistan promised to respond \"at the time and place of its choosing\".\nLess than 24 hours later, Pakistan said it had launched air strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir. It also claimed to have shot down two Indian Air Force jets in its airspace in Kashmir and arrested two pilots on the ground. India has shut down parts of its airspace in the north of the country.\nMany believe that the Pakistani strike could be seen as a tit-for-tat - it, like India, feels the need to placate its domestic constituency. But the challenge now is to contain the escalation of hostilities before things get completely out of control.\nFor one, Tuesday\'s air strikes by India were completely unexpected. They are the first launched across the LoC  - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971.\n\"Pakistani military establishment had banked on India\'s reluctance to escalate in using asymmetrical warfare (terrorism) under the nuclear umbrella,\" Professor Haqqani told me. \n\"India feels it has found a soft spot where it can strike - whether on ground using special forces as in 2016 or using air strikes as they have done now - without crossing that threshold.\"\nProfessor Haqqani says Pakistan \"does not want war with India but its military faces a credibility challenge\".\n\"It does not want to shut all jihadi groups. But the jihadis\' presence is a constant source of problems. In 2011 the Americans entered Pakistani air space to get Osama Bin Laden. Now the Indians entered Pakistani air space, dropped bombs and returned home without resistance.\n\"How will the Pakistani military explain itself to a public that accepts a huge military budget on the grounds of its military\'s ability to defend Pakistani sovereignty?\"\nDaniel Markey, a senior professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, says the problem is that \"most military solutions to the Pakistan problem at India\'s disposal are far, far more costly to India than they are likely to bring about the desired end state\". \n\"Everyone in Delhi knows this. The goal now is to introduce a higher level of punishment for each instance of Pakistani aggression. It\'s not a bad strategy, as long as each move is calculated carefully and there aren\'t too many mistakes.\n\"For instance, in this episode, some reports suggest that Indian aircraft had intended to fire from the Indian side of the LoC, but wind forced them into Pakistani territory. If true, that\'s the sort of unintended element of escalation that introduces new risk at each step.\"\nDaniel Markey believes the escalation is more serious than one anticipated - \"moving the conflict into Pakistan \'proper\' was intended to be a muscular and different move, one that most recent Indian prime ministers would have been reluctant to take\". \nSo is there a real threat of a nuclear conflict?\n\"Sadly, there is always a real threat of nuclear escalation between India and Pakistan, but we are several steps from that at this moment. Aside from accidental or unauthorised use (both unlikely), we would need to see a significant conventional escalation in this conflict before nuclear use looks likely,\" says Dr Markey.\n\"But these escalations are possible, especially if Pakistan\'s next step were to raise the stakes by hitting Indian civilian targets.\" \nThat is highly unlikely - but the question for the countries now is can they find a way of stepping back from their most dangerous flashpoint in decades?\nFollow Soutik at @soutikBBC', ' Husain Haqqani Pakistani Line Control Kashmir Kashmir Pakistani Kashmir Pakistani Haqqani Haqqani Pakistani Osama Bin Laden Pakistani Pakistani Pakistani Daniel Johns Hopkins University US Delhi Pakistani Pakistani Daniel Markey Follow Soutik', '27 2 2019'),

(109, 'Kumbh Mela festival', '\nIndia is a land of spectacles, it is a land of teeming millions and a land of an ancient culture and civilisation. \nIn my long years in India I have seen many spectacles but none so remarkable as the two Maha or Great Kumbh Melas which I attended. \nI have seen vast crowds assemble but none as big as the millions who flocked to the north Indian city of Allahabad to bathe at the confluence where the cloudy waters of the river Ganges meet the blue waters of the river Yamuna on the most auspicious day of those Melas. \nI have never been more forcefully reminded that India\'s age old culture survives today than I have been by those two Kumbh Melas.  \nAnyone who wants to enjoy the Kumbh Mela to the full must appreciate its many different aspects. \nIt is of course a great religious festival, the world\'s largest we are told, but there is much more to it than just the great bathing day, spectacular though that is. \nMost spectacular of all are the naked sadhus or holy men, who career through the crowds dancing to the frenzied beat of drums and leaping in the air as they charge in to the river to bathe.   \nThen there are the sadhus to be seen on any day performing amazing acts of asceticism. \nOne sadhu I saw had held his arm up so long that it was withered and his nails curved round like talons, another was standing on one leg, and a third lying on a bed of thorns.  \nAt Kumbh Melas there is much religious teaching also, and a multitude of discourses. \nThey demonstrate the wide variety of Hindu traditions, and Hinduism\'s tolerance too. Some of the discourses seemed to me obscurantist, some profound, and some surprising. \nThe devotees of the 15th Century saint Kabir told me they condemned  images of the deities and maintained that washing under a tap was just as good as bathing in the Ganges.  No-one seemed to object to their unorthodox views. Perhaps that\'s because Hinduism is so varied that for most Hindus there is no concept of heresy.  \nHindu pluralism is also shown by the different creation myths the Mela commemorates. \nThe word Kumbh means an urn, and one of the several myths is the story of an urn filled with the nectar of immortality which emerged from the primeval waters when they were being churned by gods and demons.  \nThe urn was snatched by demons but the son of the ruler of heaven, the god Indira, recovered it. Drops from the urn fell at the Sangam and other places in India where Kumbh Melas are held.  \nIn India, politics enter into all walks of life and the Kumbh Mela is no exception. \nIn 1989, the campaign the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hoped would bring it to power on a wave of Hindu nationalism was in full swing. \nIn one of the tented pavilions I heard fanatic speakers fulminating against the mosque in Ayodhya they claimed stood on the birth place of the god Rama, and demanding that it be pulled down to be replaced with a temple.\nMela means a fair, and as with all fairs plenty of business is done at Kumbh Melas. \nThere are stalls selling everything a pilgrim might need including of course the accoutrements required for pujas, or worship. Barbers shaving heads do a roaring trade. The traditional priests who keep family records set up their stalls and do good business updating genealogies and performing ceremonies for the souls of the dead.\nBoth Kumbh Melas I saw were remarkable feats of organisation, occasions when the much-maligned Indian civil servants covered themselves with glory. \nThey constructed a vast tented city, laying down miles of steel plates for roads and constructing pontoon bridges. The administration also insured there was food for the pilgrims, and water too - sanitation, as well as electricity.  \nThe police, not usually renowned for their gentleness, were politeness personified as they shepherded millions of pilgrims down to the river banks, keeping them in orderly queues, and insured their safety while bathing.  But in this they were helped by Indians remarkable ability to organise themselves in situations which in most other countries would degenerate into chaos.  \nOn the main bathing day of the 1989 Kumbh Mela I walked back to the press camp along with the army of pilgrims returning from the river. \nDescribing that experience I wrote: \"I had never been in such a peaceful crowd. There was no frenzy, just the calm certainty of faith; the knowledge that what had to be done had been done.\" \nFaith is the key to the Kumbh Mela. \nIt is a wonderful spectacle, a great demonstration of the variety and vigour of Hinduism, an occasion to preach politics and conduct business, but there would be no Kumbh Mela were it not for the faith that draws millions of pilgrims to the Sangam in Allahabad.

(110, 'Kumbh Mela festival', '\nAmitava Sanyal reports from India\'s Kumbh Mela, the world\'s biggest religious gathering, on the stories of three foreigners who have become top Hindu monks. \nSir James Mallinson is perhaps the only baronet to wear dreadlocks. \nThe fifth baronet of Walthamstow started growing his hair around the time he first travelled to India in 1988. \nHe had enrolled to study Sanskrit at Oxford University\'s St Peter\'s College because his only other option, Chinese, came with a \"boring introduction\". \nAt the end of his trip to India, he \"fell in\" with a group of Hindu monks in Kashmir and became fascinated with their way of life. \nIn 1992, Sir James was initiated into a Hindu order with the monastic name of Jagdish Das at Ujjain in central India. \n\"I was kidnapped by some competing monks who wanted me as their student. Finally it was Ram Balak Das who got me initiated,\" he says. \nSir James received his doctorate - on a critical translation of a 14th Century Sanskrit text on yoga - in 2002 from Balliol College, Oxford. \nIn India, when not with Hindu monks, he runs a paragliding business in Bir in the western Himalayas.\nSir James was ordained a mahant, or abbot, of a Hindu religious order in early February at the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad.\nHis friend from Eton, actor Dominic West of The Wire fame, had wanted to make a documentary on his work in India.\nWhen Sir James offered his guru some money for the film crew\'s fortnight-long stay, he was offered the post of mahant. \n\"The word translates more as a military commander than an abbot,\" says the Sanskrit scholar.\nValery Victorovich Mintsev had an experience at the age of six that he could not quite articulate. \nBut it was inspiring enough to make him stand on a rock and tell his puzzled young friends \"the ways of the universe\". \nIt took the 46-year-old monk, who is the son of a Ukrainian typographer and Soviet Communist party member, another 10 years to \"find the right words\". \nThat was when he came upon the texts of Shankaracharya, an 8th Century Indian philosopher and Hindu revivalist. \nWhile studying Cold War politics at the Kiev Higher Naval Political School, a belief that Russians and Indians are descended from the same Aryan ancestors became stronger. \n\"Why else do we have old Russian places named after Indian deities - like Ram and Sita lakes or Narada mountain?\" asks Mr Mintsev.\nA 2006 meeting with Pilot Baba, a Hindu monk who got his name because of his former career as a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force, reinforced his ideas. \nThree years ago, Mr Mintsev was initiated into a Hindu order with the monastic name of Vishnu Dev. \nLater this year the Russian monk is planning to put up a Chinese-made, 18m (59ft) bronze statue of Dattatreya, the presiding deity of his sect, at his 1,000-acre retreat situated 600km (373 miles) east of Moscow.\nWhy did he choose to be a Hindu monk? \"I have searched for freedom all my life and I got it in Hindu philosophy. It must be a great connection from a past life,\" is his explanation. \nBaba Rampuri guards his personal history - his life before he came to India from the United States in 1970 - with a fierce zeal. \nNot even those who have known him for decades know his real name. What is known is that he came from California. \nBut when asked to comment on reports that he is the son of a Jewish plastic surgeon, he laughs and says, \"maybe I was his daughter who had a sex change.\"  \nWhatever his antecedents, Baba Rampuri is today one of the most successful Hindu monks from the US. \nPart of his popularity flows from being one of the first Westerners to be initiated into the secretive Juna order of monks, the largest of the 13 powerful sects that control religious affairs at the Kumbh festival. \nThe publication of his book Autobiography of a Sadhu: A Journey into Mystic India, later added to the mystery. \nIn 2010, Baba Rampuri was made one of the three abbots of the order\'s international chapter and today he is one of the very few Hindu monks raising funds through internet-based social media.\nHe derives his monastic lineage from Keshav Puri, a monk buried outside Multan in Pakistan who is also called Multani Baba or Shamshad Tapa Rez. \n\"He is called a pir, a Sufi saint. And Muslims wearing black sit with Hindus wearing orange at his memorial meetings,\" says Baba Rampuri. \nSo possibly there was an undercurrent of commonness between the faiths that we deny today.\" \nThe belief is shared within his order but, like Baba Rampuri\'s own past, the real history is shrouded in mystery because of a lack of verifiable evidence.

Hundreds of people also take boat rides every day into the middle of the waters, where the two rivers meet.   \nThe local boatmen, called mallahs, were so bemused by Mr Turner\'s idea that they allowed him to ferry people for free in a very competitive market crowded by hundreds of oared and motor-powered boats of various sizes. Charges for an hour\'s outing on a boat can go up to $60 (£39). \nAn Indian family of two who went on Mr Turner\'s 18ft (5.4m) oared boat called their experience \"amazing\" and \"magical\".\nMr Turner has cherished his dream of ferrying pilgrims at Sangam since 1989, when as a 21-year-old backpacker in India he visited that year\'s Kumbh festival. Later, he even studied boat making in the US. \nHe persisted with the idea after he got married to Virginia \'Ginny\' Cameron. But he missed his chance of coming to the 2001 Kumbh because his twin daughters had just been born. \nSo after years of planning, Mr Turner left his 90-acre avocado and blueberry farm in Comboyne, north of Sydney, last October and arrived in Varanasi, near Allahabad, with his family. \nWhy did he want to do it? \n\"I have a huge faith in humanity that I gained the last time I was in India. Travelling on my own, I found myself in some ridiculous situations, sometimes life-threatening. \n\"And every time it was an Indian who helped me out. So we wanted to come to India and give back. I wanted the children to experience India,\" says Mr Turner, 45. The four children, aged 11 to 20, are attending Hindi language classes in Allahabad. \nThe Turners first stayed on a farm outside Varanasi but found it difficult to procure materials to build the boat and get going without any knowledge of the local language, Hindi. \nSo a month later - a couple of months before Kumbh 2013 began - they shifted to the larger city of Allahabad with not much more than \"that trust in humanity\". \nAgain, he says, a few kind strangers found them a place where they could stay and build the boat. \nWith the help of some friends and Rye, Mr Turner\'s eldest son who crafts classical guitars back home, the boat started to shape up. \nMr Turner\'s hosts, Ivan and Purnima Lamech, nicknamed him \"Noah\" after the Biblical boat builder whose father, too, was called Lamech.\nThe boat was ready by the third week of January. \nMr Turner named the boat Karuna (compassion) and on 24 January it made its way through Allahabad on a garlanded tractor led by a brass band. \nBut it had to wait another 11 days in a car park before the official paperwork was completed and it was put to the waters. \nEver since, Mr Turner, his son and friends have taken turns every day to ferry passengers. \nHe plans to carry on till the end of February, when he wants to sell the boat, recover some of his costs of more than $10,000 (£6,539), and fly back home.\nWhat did they gain from the trip? \n\"It has been a great education for the children. My two sons learned how to build a boat. And despite the pollution, I like the fact that the river [Ganges] is being honoured at the festival,\" says Ms Cameron. \nMr Turner adds: \"We have been able to show to our children that in life no matter what you do, if you stick to your guns, you\'ll be able to do what you want.

It is still unclear which of the parties will eventually form the government there.\nHowever the opposition, headed by Rahul Gandhi, has a clear lead in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, which are former BJP strongholds. \nMr Modi, whose brand of Hindu nationalism helped him come to power in 2014, campaigned aggressively in all three states. \nSoutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi\nNarendra Modi\'s grandiose promises - especially to create more jobs and increase incomes of farmers - have begun to bite. \nA lack of jobs and farmer distress will be the crucial issues at next year\'s national elections, although whether India\'s farmers will vote as an \"angry bloc\" against the government is unclear.\nBut the lack of a competitive leader to take on Mr Modi, and the failure to offer an alternative narrative of hope to the people will still make it difficult for the Congress and its allies to mount a credible challenge to Mr Modi. \nTuesday\'s verdict will surely rejuvenate the Congress, but that may not be enough to defeat a formidable ideological adversary like the BJP next year.\nRead more from Soutik\nElection results are also being declared for the southern state of Telangana and the north-eastern state of Mizoram.  \nRegional parties - the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Mizo National Front (MNF) - are headed for a landslide victory in these states.\nThe Congress was widely expected to win in the northern state of Rajasthan, while Madhya Pradesh was always seen as a close contest between the two parties. \nBBC Hindi\'s Vineet Khare says the Congress may have been overconfident in Madhya Pradesh ahead of the results.\n\"A large banner congratulating senior leader and former minister Kamal Nath was already up at the Congress headquarters yesterday.  But now it looks like both parties are still racing to reach the halfway mark they need to win. They might need help from an ally to actually form the government,\" our correspondent reports from Bhopal.\nBut results in Chhattisgarh, where the Congress appears poised to win by a wide margin, have been the most surprising. \n\"The reason behind the Congress victory is anti-incumbency because people feel that there is a lack of development in most parts of the state despite 15 years of the BJP governing there,\" reports BBC Hindi\'s Salman Ravi from the state capital Raipur. \"Farmers in particular, who have been angry about what they see as a lack of state support for their profession, voted for the Congress in large numbers. People in the state were clearly looking for change this time.\" \nAn anti-incumbency vote against the BJP in the three key states had been predicted, and some analysts point out people vote differently at state and national level.\nBut the results so far suggest a very visible setback for the BJP, which had steadily increased its state footprint since coming to office in 2014.  \nAnd issues of rural discontent - such as unemployment, lack of development and farming distress - are being seen as issues that could affect ballots next year. \nBBC Hindi\'s Nitin Srivastava who is in Rajasthan, has been posting photos of the starkly different atmospheres at the BJP and Congress party offices in the state.

(118, 'Can Priyanka Gandhi revive Indian Congress party\'s fortunes?', '\nThe Congress party, which has ruled India for most of the time since independence in 1947, has been in a state of rapid decline in recent years.\nNow with elections in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh just a few weeks away, the \"grand old party\" of India has allied with the regional Samajwadi Party which currently heads the state government, and is run by the powerful but feuding Yadav family.  \nInterestingly, the credit for this strategic alliance is being credited to Priyanka Gandhi, sister of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.\nMany in the party have fancied a larger role for Ms Gandhi for years, but this is perhaps the first time her backroom negotiating skills are being acknowledged publicly by the party.\nIn the family stronghold of Rae Bareli district in Uttar Pradesh, Ms Gandhi is held in high regard. \"If anyone in India can revive the Congress and ensure the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty remains relevant, it\'s Priyanka,\" declares Bhure Lal, 43-year-old farmer and Congress party loyalist. \nRae Bareli is represented in parliament by her mother Sonia Gandhi, Congress party chief and widow of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, and over the past 16 years, Ms Gandhi has campaigned extensively for her mother and her brother Rahul Gandhi in the nearby constituency of Amethi.\nThe Gandhi family has enjoyed cult status in these underdeveloped areas where her father Rajiv and grandmother, former PM Indira Gandhi, also won several elections.\nIn the 2014 elections, covering village after village in the blistering heat of northern India, Ms Gandhi was a hit with the masses, often sharing her home-cooked meals with people.  \nOn the campaign trail, she is often seen skipping her security cordon to talk to supporters, giving jitters to the security men, considering both her father and grandmother were assassinated.\n\"One day, after a long day of election campaign, she returned to her makeshift home in Rae Bareli and leaving her security men bewildered, decided to take her children out on a rickshaw ride in the town,\" recalls veteran journalist Umesh Raghuvanshi.\nIn recent years, the Congress has suffered several electoral setbacks - the party was reduced from 206 to 44 seats in the 543-member parliament in the 2014 general elections and also lost in the crucial states of Assam, Kerala and West Bengal, where both Rahul and the Italian-born Sonia had campaigned aggressively. \nThis has led to demands within the party to bring Priyanka, perceived by many to be more popular than her bachelor brother, to the forefront.\nBut the 44-year-old mother-of-two has been reluctant to take centre stage and prefers to work only in the family bastions.\nIn Amethi, which her brother has represented as an MP since 2004, Ms Gandhi has kept close tabs on the mood of the voters. \nDuring the 2014 polls, when Mr Gandhi was busy campaigning for Congress candidates elsewhere, it was she who is credited with ensuring the defeat of his opponent Smriti Irani, television actress and now a cabinet minister. \n\"Had it not been for her, Rahul Gandhi would have lost. Sensing her brother was losing popularity, Priyanka devoted extra time to the constituency, reminding people of the sacrifices her family had made for the country. Rahul won but his victory margin decreased considerably and that was embarrassing,\" says Lal Bahadur Khan, a Congress supporter in Amethi. \nThose who have worked closely with her praise the easy connections she makes with the masses.\n\"Her biggest asset is the instant connect she makes with the voter and her fluency in Hindi. She makes people feel as if they are interacting with the person next door,\" says Sanjay Singh, a former Amethi royal and MP.\nMs Gandhi had previously displayed no political ambition and always endorsed her bother as the one who has political insight, dedication and conviction to run the party.\n\"I don\'t think I would be able to have a normal quiet life if I was in active politics. When I am not helping my mother or brother in their constituencies, I am making cupcakes for my two kids and buying groceries,\" she told Outlook magazine in a rare interview.\nBut now, she has been officially listed as one of the political campaigners for the Congress party in this election. \nAnd although Ms Gandhi has insisted that she has no political ambitions, many are unconvinced that her family will stay away from politics. \nHer flashy and flamboyant husband Robert Vadra has hinted in the past that he is not averse to entering politics.\nHe has been accused of wrongdoing in his real estate business in the states of Haryana and Rajasthan and is being investigated by the BJP government in Haryana. \nMr Vadra and the Gandhis have denied the allegations and accuse the BJP of a \"political witch hunt\".\nSome, however, say it will take much more than the charms of Ms Gandhi to stall the Congress party\'s slide. They also wonder if she has the political acumen and flair to lead the party. \nA long-time Congress worker and local party administrator in Rae Bareli, Ram Sevak Chaudhary, says she may be the \"best bet\" to revive the floundering party, but \"she is mostly surrounded by sycophants\".  \n\"When we lost the 2012 state polls, she asked me the reasons for the loss. I bluntly told her that the faulty candidate selection by her team was one of the reasons. She looked visibly upset and I was thrown out of the local organisational set-up the following month,\" he says.  \nCritics also say that with the Congress losing ground fast, the party must take a call on launching Ms Gandhi before it\'s too late.\nBut between the raging debate of \"will she or won\'t she\" lies the traumatic experience of a young girl who saw her father and grandmother being killed while on political duty. \nSo despite being the biggest crowd-puller amongst the Gandhis currently, it may be a completely emotional decision if she ever decided to join politics, says analyst Rasheed Kidwai. \n\"Sonia Gandhi is ageing and it\'s clear that she wants to pass on the mantle to Rahul Gandhi who appears to be a bit unsure.

A strategically tactile leader, Mr Modi has freely embraced world leaders, while preferring to keep a distance at home.  \nLast week, Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress, turned the tables on Mr Modi. After making a biting speech targeting Mr Modi\'s performance during a no-confidence motion - which the opposition lost - the 48-year-old dynast surprised his political foe in the parliament with a giant unexpected hug. \nMr Modi and his party revel in mocking Mr Gandhi and his enfeebled party, which has been reduced to a rump in the parliament. Mr Gandhi has also been the butt of coarse jokes by trolls supported by Mr Modi\'s BJP in social media. \"You have hate in your hearts for me...and hurl choice abuses at me, but in my heart, I have no hate for you,\" Mr Gandhi, said before walking over to a sitting Mr Modi, and surprising him with a clearly unwanted embrace.\nThe hug made national headlines and the media went into a tizzy, generating an ungainly hashtag #hugoplacy on social media. Some called the it a \"historic\" hug, and proved that Mr Gandhi was a more astute politician than what his rivals gave him credit for. \nOthers said the once-reluctant leader was finally learning the idiom of clever telegenic politics which would help him outsmart the formidable Mr Modi, known for his killer instinct and take-no-prisoners approach. \"In the picture, Mr Modi seems burdened by his role, while Mr Gandhi looks ready for a certain inventiveness. It is as if he is signalling a change in style,\" sociologist Shiv Visvanathan told me. \nA leading commentator called the hug \"dramatic, unlikely and unexpected\", and the result of a \"pure, deliberate, coldly-crafted strategy\". Barkha Dutt wrote that Mr Gandhi wants people to believe that the hug \"is the politics of love vs the politics of hate - that a new-generation metrosexual gentleness can combat hard-line machismo.\" One newspaper breathlessly reported that the carefully-executed \"hug plan\" took place in February. \nA dairy firm put out a cartoon, wondering whether it was an act of embracing or an attempt at embarrassing Mr Modi.\nI believe the cartoon got it right. Many believe that the embrace was a brave gesture by Mr Gandhi in the \"spirit of friendship\" in \"a toxic environment of masculinist politics\" under Mr Modi. But the seemingly bipartisan hug appeared to be more of an ambush than an embrace. \nMr Gandhi may well have been inspired by US President Lyndon Johnson who famously said his philosophy was to \"hug your friends tight, but your enemies tighter - hug \'em so tight that they can\'t wiggle.\" ', ' Narendra Modi Rahul Gandhi Modi Gandhi Gandhi Modi Shiv Visvanathan Barkha Dutt Lyndon Johnson', '26 7 2018'),

I also saw his plane get hit and saw him float down,\" Mohammad Razzaq Chaudhry, a resident of Bhimber district in Pakistani-administered Kashmir who witnessed the moment the jet was shot down on Wednesday, told BBC\'s Ilyas Khan.\nHe added that locals rushed to the fallen pilot and that he was \"afraid\" that they might harm him. \nMr Chaudhry said that some of the men were angry and attacked the pilot while others tried to stop them. \"I told them not to harm him - to leave him alone  until the army comes.\" \nLocal media in India reported that crowds began thronging his family home soon after news of his capture spread. The Hindustan Times newspaper quoted one of his relatives as saying that they wanted the government to \"secure his release\" without delay.\nHis family has refused to comment about his capture. \nThe son of a decorated former fighter pilot, Wing Cdr Abhinandan was first commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2004. His mother is a doctor. He is reported to be in his mid-30s. \nHis father, Air Marshal Simhakutty Varthaman, worked with decorated Tamil film maker Mani Ratnam, acting as an adviser for his 2017 film, Kaatru Veliyidai, which was set against the backdrop of the 1999 Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan. Mr Varthaman was the air marshal at the time. \nThe Kargil conflict was the last time an Indian solider was captured and held by Pakistani forces. Group Captain K Nachiketa, who was also an air force pilot, was in Pakistan\'s custody for eight days after his jet crashed in their territory. \nHe is now retired and lives in the southern city of Hyderabad.\n\"He [Wing Cdr Abhinandan] should be treated appropriately as an officer and sent back to India,\" Group Captain Nachiketa told BBC Telugu. \"He is brave and courageous and we are all proud of him.\" \nHe added that he did not want to talk about his capture but said that \"all officers are trained for this and I am sure he will be with us shortly and join his unit again soon.\"\nA clip of his appearance on a local television show - NDTV Good Times - in 2011 is also being circulated widely. \nIn it, he is heard joking about how you need a \"bad attitude\" to be a successful fighter pilot. \nHe also talks about how you trust your colleagues with your life, referring to \"blind faith\" in your co-pilot when you\'re in the air. \nIndia had initially said that all of its pilots were accounted for, contradicting Pakistani claims that they had captured a pilot.\nHowever Pakistan\'s information ministry then released - and later deleted - a video showing the pilot blindfolded and with blood on his face. This prompted a furious Delhi to summon Islamabad\'s deputy high commissioner and condemn what it called the \"vulgar display of an injured personnel\". \nIn later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold. He appeared to have been cleaned up.\nHe said his name, military position and that he was from \"down south\", but refused to share any details when asked about his mission: \"I\'m not supposed to tell you that.\"\nIn what appeared to be an edited statement aired on Pakistan TV minutes before he was handed over, the wing commander praised the Pakistani army, adding he saw potential for peace. \nThe wing commander also criticised the Indian press, saying they always exaggerate and say a lot of damaging things that mislead people.

(121, 'Viewpoint: Balakot air strikes raise stakes in India-Pakistan stand-off', '\nAfter India launched air strikes in Pakistani territory, tensions have escalated between the neighbours. Indian defence analyst Ajai Shukla explains the significance of the attack and what could happen next. \nThe ball is in Pakistan\'s court after Indian Air Force (IAF) Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft crossed deep into Pakistan on Tuesday morning. India says that the air strikes targeted a militant camp near Balakot in the  province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, Pakistan has disputed this claim, saying the strikes hit an empty area. \nThe air strikes were provoked by the killing of at least 40 paramilitaries in Indian-administered Kashmir on 14 February, in a suicide attack which has been claimed by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad. Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had vowed revenge.\nTuesday\'s air strikes are the first launched across the LoC (line of control) - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971.\nNot even during the 1999 Kargil war did Indian aircraft cross the LoC.\nBoth militaries have scrupulously observed a confidence-building measure that prohibits fixed-wing aircraft from flying within 10km (6.21 miles) of the LoC and helicopters from coming closer than 5km without informing the other side beforehand. For the first time, India has deliberately breached this contract.\nIn the unwritten set of rules that govern action and reaction between the two militaries on the LoC, air strikes constitute a major escalation, which is significantly higher than punishing Pakistani posts by cross-border firing, or even sending ground troops across.\nThese air strikes have gone several steps ahead of the \"surgical strikes\" of 2016, when India attacked militant camps across the LoC after Indian soldiers were killed in an attack by Pakistan-backed militants. \nThe apparent ease with which Indian air force fighters flew 80km into Pakistan-administered territory, undetected by a military that should have been on high alert after open Indian threats of attack, again exposes the rudimentary capability of Pakistani air defences. This should reinforce the concern that arose in 2011, when American helicopters flew undetected into Pakistan, carrying naval commandos who killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and flew out with his body. \nAfter India\'s air strikes, escalation is possible - but not certain. Pakistan has warned of retaliation and threatened to take the issue to the United Nations. \nBut like after the \"surgical strikes\", Pakistan has again downplayed the attack. It first stated that this was a limited incursion by a few Indian air force fighters, which fled when the Pakistani air force scrambled its jets. The Pakistani army\'s public relations chief then switched tack and claimed that the bombs did no damage before adding that the place that was struck, Balakot, was just 5-6km across the LoC. \nThis obfuscation is made possible by the fact that there are two towns by the name of Balakot - one just across the LoC from the Indian town of Poonch, and the other deep inside Pakistan in its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The BBC reports that the strikes were in the latter, where local villagers say they heard explosions.\nHaving denied a deep incursion by the Indian air force, Pakistan has reduced its burden of retaliation. \nIt remains to be seen whether more compelling evidence eventually embarrasses Pakistan\'s military into having to respond. For now, India has indicated that it has achieved its aims. Pakistan is unlikely to raise the ante beyond a point, given that escalating tension is a game with uncertain outcomes.\nMeanwhile, the Indian military has been placed on alert, with leave of personnel restricted. The air force is patrolling airspace, while the Indian Navy, which had been involved in a major exercise, has shifted to combat mode.\nAdditionally, security forces in Kashmir have been boosted significantly, with the Indian government readying for the possibility of increased militant activity backed by Pakistan.', ' Pakistani Ajai Shukla Indian Air Force Narendra Modi Kashmir Pakistani Pakistani Osama Laden Abbottabad Pakistani Balakot Poonch Kashmir', '26 2 2019'),

Permission for the interview was granted under the previous Congress-led government.  The ruling BJP will have wanted to distance itself from that decision.\nIt also wanted to be seen to be acting swiftly as controversy around the film blew up.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh said last Wednesday that the entire nation was \"ashamed\" by Mukesh Singh\'s words. \nAnd the decision to ban the film was widely supported initially.  \nIn the first couple of days after the ban even some leading Indian feminists supported it, arguing that the rapist should not be given a platform to express his repellent views. \nSince then support has weakened and the consensus now, certainly in India\'s newspapers, seems to be that the ban is misguided.\nThat\'s because many of the arguments put forward to justify the ban have been called into question.\nThe initial grounds for the ban were that broadcast of the film - or more precisely the interview with one of the men convicted of the savage rape and murder of a young Indian woman on a Delhi bus - could threaten public order. \nThe comments the rapist makes are certainly incendiary.  Mukesh Singh appears to show no remorse for his crime and seems to be suggesting that, by fighting back, his victim was responsible for her own murder. \nSome commentators have suggested that there is a link between elevated tensions around the issue of rape and the lynching of a rape suspect in the state of Nagaland in the north east of India.  \nIt is a controversial claim.  Vigilante justice is not uncommon in India, particularly over emotive crimes like rape.  \nAnd Nagaland notwithstanding, there hasn\'t been any significant disorder, despite the huge controversy around the film. Certainly nothing like the huge protest movement that grew up in the days after the original attack back in December 2012.  \nAnother big area of debate has been whether the filmmakers got proper permission to film in Tihar, the prison where Singh is being held.  \nThe director, Leslee Udwin, released her correspondence with the prison authorities to the media over the weekend. She says it supports her claim that there was no deception or breach of agreement on her part. \nThen there was the claim that broadcasting the interview could prejudice future legal action, in particular the rapist\'s appeal against his death sentence in the Supreme Court.\nThat\'s been roundly rejected by the Editors Guild of India.  It said that it was \"an insult\" to the highest court in India to suggest that airing the convict\'s \"perverted views\" would interfere with the course of justice.\nSo the Indian government is now in the uncomfortable position of having to defend an increasingly unpopular ban.\nA senior government minister, M Venkaiah Naidu, described the documentary as \"a conspiracy to defame India\".  \nOn that basis the ban was designed to protect the good name of India in the world.\nBut as party chiefs survey the headlines around the globe they would be hard pressed not to conclude that banning India\'s Daughter has been far more damaging to India\'s reputation abroad than an open discussion of the issues raised by the film would ever have been.', ' Rajnath Singh Mukesh Singh Delhi Mukesh Singh Tihar Singh Leslee Udwin Editors Guild India M Venkaiah Naidu', '10 3 2015'),
(127, 'Asifa Bano: The child rape and murder that has Kashmir on edge', '\nThe brutal gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Indian-administered Kashmir has put the restive state on edge. Sameer Yasir, an independent journalist based in Srinagar, reports on how the investigation has split the region along religious lines.\nOn the morning of 17 January, Muhammad Yusuf Pujwala was sitting outside his home in Kathua when one of his neighbours came running towards him. He stopped in front of Mr Pujwala and broke the news: they had found his eight-year-old daughter, Asifa Bano. Her body lay in bushes in the forest, a few hundred metres away.\n\"I knew something horrible had happened to my girl,\" Mr Pujwala, a 52-year-old with deep sunken eyes, told the BBC in an interview recently. His wife, Naseema Bibi, sat beside him, faintly crying while repeatedly murmuring \"Asifa\".\nMr Pujwala belongs to a community of Muslim nomadic shepherds called Gujjars who crisscross the Himalayas with their goats and buffaloes. \nThe crime has shocked the community, exposing the fault lines between Hindu-majority Jammu and the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in a sharply divided state. The Kashmir valley has a tumultuous relationship with India - there has been an armed revolt in the region against Indian rule since 1989.\nPolice have arrested eight men, including a retired government official, four police officers and a juvenile in connection with Asifa\'s death. \nHowever, the arrests sparked protests in Jammu - lawyers tried to stop police entering the court to file a charge sheet and two ministers from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused.\nThe BJP rules the state in a coalition with the regional People\'s Democratic Party (PDP).\nWhen she went missing on 10 January, her family was living in a village around 72km (45 miles) east of Jammu city. On that afternoon, her mother recalls, Asifa went to the forest to bring home the horses. The horses returned but Asifa did not.\nMs Naseema informed her husband. He and some neighbours started looking for her. Armed with flash lights, lanterns and axes, they went deep into the forest and searched through the night. But they could not find her.\nTwo days later, on 12 January, the family filed a police complaint. But, according to Mr Pujwala, the police were not helpful. One of the police officers, he alleges, said Asifa must have \"eloped\" with a boy.  \nAs news of the crime spread, Gujjar staged protests and blocked a highway, forcing police to assign two officers for the search. One of those who was assigned, Deepak Khajuria, was himself arrested in connection with the crime.  \nFive days later, Asifa\'s body was found. \n\"She had been tortured. Her legs were broken,\" recalled Ms Naseema, who had rushed to the forest along with her husband to see the body. \"Her nails had turned black and there were blue and red marks on her arm and fingers.\"\nOn 23 January, six days after Asifa\'s body was found, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, ordered a investigation by the crime branch, a special unit of the state police. \nAccording to the investigators, Asifa was confined in a local temple for several days and given sedatives that kept her unconscious. The charge sheet alleges that she was \"raped for days, tortured and then finally murdered\". She was strangled to death and then hit on the head twice with a stone. \nSanji Ram, a 60-year-old retired government officer, allegedly planned the crime with the help of police officers Surender Verma, Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Mr Khajuria.\nMr Ram\'s son, Vishal, his nephew, a juvenile, and his friend, Parvesh Kumar, are also accused over the rape and murder.  \nInvestigators allege that Mr Khajuria and the other police officers - some of whom lodged the complaint and accompanied the family in the search - washed Asifa\'s bloodied and mud-spattered clothes before sending them to a forensic lab. \nThey believe that the accused men wished to terrorise the Gujjar community into leaving Jammu. The shepherds use public and forest land in Jammu for grazing, which has recently brought them into conflict with some Hindu residents in the region.\n\"It was about land,\" said Talib Hussain, a tribal rights activist and lawyer. Mr Hussain, who led a protest in support of Asifa\'s family, alleges he was arrested and threatened by local police.\nAnkur Sharma, one of the lawyers who protested on behalf of the accused, alleged that the Muslim nomads were trying to alter the demographics of Jammu, where Hindus are currently the majority. \"They are encroaching our forests and water resources,\" he told the BBC. He said the accused had been falsely implicated while the real culprits were still free. \nWhile the crime did not receive much attention in Jammu, newspapers in Srinagar, the capital city located in the Kashmir valley, carried the story on their front pages. \nIn Jammu and Kashmir state assembly, Mian Altaf, an influential Gujjar leader and an opposition legislator, waved the newspapers with photographs of Asifa while demanding an inquiry. Rajiv Jasrotia, a BJP lawmaker, said the incident was a \"family matter\" and blamed Mr Altaf for politicising the crime. \nThe Gujjars wanted to bury Asifa in a graveyard where they had purchased some land a few years ago and had already buried five people. But when they arrived there, Mr Pujwala said, they were surrounded by Hindu right-wing activists who threatened them with violence if they were to continue with the burial. \n\"We had to walk seven miles to bury her in another village,\" Mr Pujwala said. Two of his daughters were killed in an accident some years ago. On his wife\'s insistence, he adopted Asifa, the daughter of his brother-in-law.\nHis wife described Asifa as a \"chirping bird\" who ran like a \"deer\". When they travelled, she looked after the herd. \n\"That made her the darling of the community,\" Ms Bibi said. \"She was the centre of our universe.\"', ' Kashmir Sameer Muhammad Yusuf Pujwala Pujwala Asifa Bano Naseema Bibi Gujjars Jammu Kashmir Asifa Jammu Jammu Asifa Asifa Naseema Asifa Gujjar Deepak Khajuria Asifa Asifa Jammu Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti Asifa Sanji Anand Dutta Tilak Raj Parvesh Kumar Asifa Gujjar Jammu Jammu Talib Hussain Asifa Jammu Hindus Jammu Kashmir Mian Altaf Asifa Rajiv Jasrotia Pujwala Hindu Pujwala Asifa Bibi', '12 4 2018'),
(128, 'Why are millions of Indian women dropping out of work?', '\nWhy are millions of women dropping out of work in India?\nThe numbers are stark - for the first time in India\'s recent history, not only was there a decline in the female labour participation rate, but also a shrinking of the total number of women in the workforce.\nUsing data gleaned from successive rounds of National Sample Survey Organisation and census data, a team of researchers from World Bank have attempted to find out why this is happening.\n\"These are significant matters of concern. As India poises itself to increase economic growth and foster development, it is necessary to ensure that its labour force becomes fully inclusive of women,\" says the study, authored by Luis A Andres, Basab Dasgupta, George Joseph, Vinoj Abraham and Maria Correia. \nSo what accounts for the unprecedented and puzzling drop in women\'s participation in the workforce - at a time when India\'s economy has grown at a steady pace?\nPredictable social norms are attributed to women quitting work in India: marriage, motherhood, vexed gender relations and biases, and patriarchy.\nBut they may not be the only reasons. Marriage, for example, does affect the rate of participation of women in the workforce. But in villages, the workforce participation rate of married women has been found to be higher than that of unmarried women - whereas in the cities, the situation is reversed.\nSignificantly, rising aspirations and relative prosperity may be actually responsible for putting a large cohort of women out of work in India.\nRemember, the largest drop has been in the villages. \nAfter calculating the labour force participation rates and educational participation rates (young women in schools) the researchers believe that one plausible explanation for the drop in the participation rate among rural girls and women aged 15-24 is the recent expansion of secondary education and rapidly changing social norms leading to \"more working age young females opting to continue their education rather than join the labour force early\".\nThe study says there has been a \"larger response to income changes among the poor, rather than the wealthy, by sending children to school\".\nAlso, casual workers - mainly women - drop out of the workforce when wages increased for regular earners - mainly men - leading to the stabilisation of family incomes.\n\"Improved stability in family income can be understood as a disincentive for female household members to join the labour force,\" says the study.\n\"This largely resonates with the existing literature, which suggests that with rising household income levels, women in rural India withdraw from paid labour and engage in status production at home.\"\nBut dropping or opting out of the workforce to go to school and get an education may not ensure that these women will eventually go to work.\nAfter studying the relationship with the female labour participation rate and levels of educational achievements, the researchers found that having a high school-level education was \"not found to be an incentive for women\" to work. \nThe lowest rate of participation is among those who had secured school and high school education in the cities and villages. And the rate is actually highest among illiterates and college graduates. \nBut there has been a general drop in the rate in recent years, indicating that irrespective of educational attainments, \"the incentive for women to participate in the workforce has declined over this period\".\nTo be sure, India has a poor record of female participation in the workforce: the International Labour Organisation ranked it 121 out of 131 countries in 2013, one of the lowest in the world.  \nAlso, India is not an outlier when it comes to women dropping out of the workforce. \nBetween 2004 and 2012, the female labour force participation rate in China dropped from 68% to 64%, but the participation rate remains very high compared with India. In neighbouring Sri Lanka, for example, the participation rate has dropped, but only by 2%.\n\"India stands out because of a such a sharp decline within such a short period. In levels, it is very low in international rankings now,\" the researchers told me.\nClearly women need better and more suitable job opportunities, outside agriculture. Rural labour markets need to offer jobs that are acceptable and attractive to women and their families.\nThe World Bank study suggests that gains will not be realised unless social norms around women\'s - and men\'s - work also change:\n\"Strategies to communicate the importance of women\'s work should take into account the roles of women, husbands and in-laws.\"\nAlso, as another study says, the \"ongoing decrease in the availability of farm-based work, has led to women focusing on economic activities within their households\". Should home-based workers then be counted as members of the labour force?', ' Luis A Andres Basab Dasgupta George Joseph Vinoj Abraham Maria Correia Sri Lanka', '18 5 2017');

(129, 'Is Narendra Modi losing his mojo?', '\nOne of the reasons why Narendra Modi swept to victory with a historic mandate in 2014 was his combative and upbeat oratory. Three years on, the Indian prime minister is beginning to sound unusually defensive.\nMany say Mr Modi\'s characteristic bluster and bombast have begun to wane. In recent speeches, he has described his critics as doomsayers, blamed the previous Congress government for India\'s economic ills, painted himself as an \"outsider\" and said he was \"willing to drink poison\" for the good of the country. Has the victor turned victim? \n\"A small number of people weaken us,\" Mr Modi told a gathering of company secretaries recently. \"We need to recognise such people.\" \nSo is Mr Modi beginning to lose his mojo? Three years ago, when he won his landslide, he promised reforms and jobs. But under his leadership - and at a time when the world economy appears to be taking off - India is looking like a sorry outlier, battling an economic slowdown and a jobs crisis. \nBanks are struggling with mountains of bad loans, which in turn has choked credit and hurt domestic investment. \"India\'s economy is grounded,\" says economist Praveen Chakravarty. \nMr Modi\'s response has been criticised as piecemeal and clumsy. A controversial currency ban last November, politically sold as a crackdown on the illegal economy, ended up halting growth and causing a lot of misery. \nJuly\'s introduction of a much-lauded countrywide Goods and Services Tax (GST) to help India move towards a common market has caused widespread business disruption because of what is seen as shoddy execution. \nIn cities and towns, traders are upset over the grinding tax bureaucracy engendered by the GST. In villages - nearly half of Indians are engaged in agriculture - farmers are complaining of income insecurity as they believe the government isn\'t paying them enough for their produce. \nAlso, for the first time since winning power, Mr Modi\'s government is under attack. \nA senior functionary from Mr Modi\'s party, the BJP, recently blamed his government for the economic slowdown. \"The prime minister claims that he has seen poverty from close quarters,\" former finance minister Yashwant Sinha wrote. \"His finance minister is working overtime to make sure that all Indians also see it from equally close quarters.\" \nAnd Mr Modi is taking flak from the opposition too for a change. His main political rival, Rahul Gandhi, of the once mighty Congress party, appears to be suddenly re-energised and has been taking on Mr Modi more aggressively than ever before. \nAdded to this, the son of Amit Shah, Mr Modi\'s closest aide, is accused of corruption. Jay Shah denies the allegations and has threatened to sue non-profit news website The Wire over the story.\nThus far since taking office, Mr Modi has been greatly helped by four unrelated things. \nLow oil prices - India imports most of its crude - helped boost growth and tame inflation. Second, a chunk of the domestic mainstream media which depends on government advertising has been largely uncritical of his government. Third, Mr Modi faces no leadership challenge from within his party, which he and Amit Shah dominate. Lastly, and most importantly, a political opposition largely in disarray has failed to offer aspirational Indians an alternative - and persuasive - narrative of hope.\nStill, there\'s \"something in the air\", as Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Print news site, says. \nOne indication is that even Mr Modi\'s fiercely pugnacious supporters are markedly subdued on social media these days. On the other hand, social media is awash with memes making fun of the prime minister.  \nMr Modi\'s politics are also causing discontent. By whipping up what many say is hysteria over the sale and consumption of beef and pandering to Hindu radicals, observers say his party has begun to frighten off many young people and urban folk. \nTo make matters worse, his party appointed a controversial Hindu religious leader known for anti-Muslim rhetoric to run the political bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP won a decisive mandate in March. About a fifth of Uttar Pradesh\'s 200 million people are Muslim.\nIn 2014, Mr Modi secured the overwhelming majority of the young votes. But is support from this quarter waning? BJP-supported student unions have lost elections in three major universities in Delhi and Hyderabad. Last month\'s unrest in a leading university in Mr Modi\'s constituency in Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, where police beat female university students protesting against an alleged sexual assault, will not endear him and his party to young voters. \nOn the economy, Mr Modi clearly seems to have overplayed his hand and questions are being asked over whether he can fulfil expectations. In June, the Economist said Mr Modi was \"not the radical reformer he is cracked up to be\". The magazine said he had few big ideas of his own - the GST, for example, had been initiated during the previous, Congress, regime. \nCritics say despite running India\'s most powerful government in recent history, he has achieved little in creating functioning markets for land and electricity, and reforming labour laws. On his politics, they say, Mr Modi appears to be hostage to the party\'s ideological fountainhead, the right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers\' Organisation), known for what many say are visions of Hindu glory and achievement.\nEconomists such as Dr Chakravarty believe Mr Modi still has time to revive the economy by exploiting the buoyant stock market, which is flush with money from foreign institutional investors. Money could be raised by divesting stakes in state-run companies and used to recapitalise and clean up the ailing banks, so that they can begin lending again. \nAlso the rupee could be depreciated to boost exports, the GST simplified further to help small businesses and interest rates lowered to spur growth. Growth will also depend on social stability, but it is not clear whether Mr Modi will be able to rein in the radical hotheads.\nHowever, Mr Modi is a redoubtable fighter. It is too early to say the tide is turning against him decisively. One opinion poll in August indicated he would win handsomely if elections were held. But then again, a month can be a long time in politics. State elections in BJP-ruled Gujarat in December will offer some clues - a recent survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) suggested people were \"unhappy with GST\". Nobody expects the BJP to lose, but the margin of victory will be closely watched. \nAmong his supporters, Mr Modi enjoys a reputation of being a hardworking and honest prime minister. \"What has helped in stopping this wind of dissatisfaction from turning into a strong hurricane are two factors - the absence of a viable alternative, and the personal credibility of Mr Modi,\" says political scientist Sanjay Kumar. \n\"The only question that remains is: how long will Mr Modi be able to hold down this wave of resentment with his own image and credibility?\" And right now that answer is blowing in the wind.

(130, 'Viewpoint: How far might India go to \'punish\' Pakistan?', '\nA suicide attack killed more than 40 members of the Indian security forces in restive Indian-administered Kashmir on 14 February. Threats from Indian leaders, who face a tricky general election before May, raise the spectre of Indian military retaliation against Pakistan for alleged \"state-sponsored terrorism\", writes Indian defence analyst Ajai Shukla.\nIndian Prime Minister Narenda Modi has pledged to give security forces free rein to respond to the militant attack - the deadliest in the region in three decades. \"Terrorist organisations and their backers\", he said, will pay a \"heavy price\". Home Minister Rajnath Singh blamed Pakistan for the attack and threatened a \"strong reply\". Influential Indian television networks are baying for revenge.\nThe car bombing has been claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which numerous countries, and the United Nations, have designated a terrorist group. Its leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, was captured and imprisoned in the 1990s by Indian forces. He was later released as part of a hostage exchange after an Indian airliner headed to Delhi was hijacked to Kabul in 1999. Delhi has always held Pakistan responsible for that hijacking.\nFor several years now, India has been pressuring the UN to designate Azhar a \"global terrorist\", but China - a close ally of Pakistan - has repeatedly blocked that move.\nThe involvement of JeM in the car bombing directly links Pakistan to the attack. In 2001, a Jaish suicide squad attacked the Indian parliament, killing nine security personnel and triggering an Indian military mobilisation against Pakistan that kept the two countries on the brink of war for months. \nIn 2016, Jaish attacks on Indian military facilities in Pathankot and Uri resulted in the Indian army launching \"surgical strikes\" on Pakistani military targets and terrorist camps across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border.\nThis time, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government could feel pressured to do more. The 2016 strikes were deliberately limited in time and choice of targets, allowing Pakistan to deny that they took place at all. \nThe Indian military has acknowledged contingency plans exist for punishing Pakistan more severely in the event of a damaging terrorist attack. But all such plans carry the danger of retaliation and uncontrolled escalation. This fear is exacerbated by the fact that both countries possess nuclear weapons. Pakistan has repeatedly signalled it would not hesitate to use them.\nFor now, Pakistan\'s foreign office has tweeted its \"grave concern\" and rejected \"any insinuation by elements in Indian government and media circles that seek to link the attack to State of Pakistan without investigations\". However, given that JeM has claimed credit for the car bomb attack and Masood Azhar roams free in Pakistan, Indian public opinion is unlikely to demand much more by way of proof.\nPakistan\'s central intelligence agency, the army-controlled Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), faces a conundrum with regard to the Jaish. Unlike the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which unquestioningly follows the politically dominant Pakistan army\'s orders, the Jaish has not shrunk from attacking Pakistani military targets. The group even carried out two deadly bomb attacks on the country\'s former military leader Pervez Musharraf in 2003. \nGiven the Jaish\'s utility in keeping the Kashmir pot bubbling, Pakistan\'s army has turned a blind eye towards it so far. It remains to be seen whether serious pressure from India - and possibly from China, which might believe it has gone far enough in sheltering Azhar - could result in the group being shut down.\nAway from the geo-politics, there is also an important local dynamic to the car bombing. Over the last year, Indian security forces have killed almost 300 Kashmir militants, with most of them from the south Kashmir pocket where the car bombing took place. The militant groups, therefore, faced a pressing need to reassert their presence with a high-visibility attack. The predominant group in the area, the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, regards suicide attacks as anti-Islamic. That left the onus on the Jaish and the LeT.\nFor India\'s security establishment, this was an unalloyed intelligence disaster. The police and intelligence agencies face questions over how the Jaish managed to stage such an attack on a huge Indian convoy - which would have involved rigging up a car with a large amount of explosives, carrying out reconnaissance, rehearsals and penetrating several layers of security.\nFor now, the Indian establishment is weighing its options. Economic moves - including removing Pakistan\'s Most Favoured Nations trade benefits - have already been decided. The Indian government is also talking about diplomatic isolation. But in the absence of any Pakistani action against the Jaish, there will be more to come.', ' Ajai Shukla Narenda Modi Rajnath Singh Maulana Masood Azhar Delhi Azhar Pathankot Uri Pakistani Line Control Masood Azhar Pakistani Pervez Musharraf Jaish Kashmir Azhar Jaish LeT Jaish Pakistani', '15 2 2019'),

The BBC\'s M Ilyas Khan visited the border area to find out what actually happened.\nIndia \'launches strikes against militants\'\nKashmir attack: What\'s behind the deadliest militant raid in years?\nDespite the use of the term \"surgical strikes\", the Indians definitely did not airdrop commandos to hit \"launching pads of militants\" inside Pakistani-held territory, or conduct ground assaults deep into the Pakistan-administered side. But they did cross the Line of Control (LoC), in some cases by more than a kilometre, to hit nearby Pakistani border posts.\nPolice officials on the Pakistani side privately concede that such a ground assault did occur in the Madarpur-Titrinot region of Poonch sector, west of Srinagar, where a Pakistani post was destroyed and one soldier killed.\nIn Leepa valley to the north, locals said that the Indians crossed the LoC and set up their guns on ridges directly overlooking the village of Mundakali. A Pakistani border post located at some distance east of the village was hit. Two other posts higher up in the mountains were also hit. At least four Pakistani soldiers were injured in the attack, which lasted from 05:00am until 8:00am, locals said.\nA similar advance by the Indians in the Dudhnial area of Neelum valley further north was beaten back by the Pakistanis. At least one Pakistani soldier was injured - reports of a dead soldier could not be independently verified by the BBC.\nThe Pakistani army described the exchanges as nothing more than cross-border firing, albeit in a more co-ordinated fashion and all along the LoC. \nOfficials said two soldiers were killed in the attacks - one in Poonch, and one in Bhimber sector, further south. Defence minister Khwaja Asif later said a total of nine soldiers were injured in the assault.\nIndian troops could not have hit a target and returned alive as the climb required was too steep, officials said. Nor could helicopters have been used to drop special forces given the difficult terrain and because Pakistan would have shot down the aircraft.\nThere is no conclusive evidence to prove either side\'s claims - the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.\nIndian army\'s anger over Kashmir killings\nWhy India needs cool heads\nI normally wake up at 4:30am. As usual I did my chores - and just then I heard small arms fire, about 100 rounds. I waited a few minutes and then I heard four bombs [mortars] land near the village. We have been in a state of war for a long time, so I knew that heavy guns meant trouble and that the village might get hit. I was standing there when four more bombs came. Then four more, after a few minutes.\nThe first shells had landed in the forest near the village [where a border post is located] and I saw flames and smoke rising. My wife called to me to get in. We have built a bunker in the basement with 24-inch thick walls. She said everybody was inside, and wanted me to get in too. \nBy now they had started targeting another one of our posts higher up on the mountaintop in front. Then the next round of shells hit another post further back.\nSmall arms fire also continued. This was surprising for me. They had apparently crossed over from the LoC and had set up their guns at the top of the cliff. I could heard the bullets whizzing overhead, through the treetops, snapping twigs and leaves that were falling to the ground.\nThe firing continued until about 6am. After that, the heavy guns fell silent but small fire continued. We remained in our basement until 10am. No one had had time to eat or drink that morning.\nLater, we heard that the Indians had crossed the LoC and hit our posts from positions overlooking the valley. I don\'t understand why they didn\'t try to reach our post where we have the local company headquarters. They could have done it. It\'s walkable, and is easier for them because they occupy higher ground. Perhaps our people detected their movement and fired at them which pushed them back.\nThis is the first time since the war on the LoC began nearly 30 years ago that they have fired from this position.\nIn many areas the attack came as a surprise.\nAccounts of villagers gathered in Leepa suggest that Indian soldiers first opened fire in the valley at around 0500, hitting the post near Mundakali village and blowing up a mosque adjacent to it.\nA soldier who was preparing for pre-dawn prayers was hit and injured, they said.\nFire was also directed at two other posts higher up in the hills, one of which served as the forward headquarters in Leepa.\nLocals say bunkers at these posts were partly destroyed and their communication system was paralysed for some time. This meant that troops stationed down in the valley and at the brigade headquarters took a while to realise what was going on.\nThe soldier who was injured at the Mundakali post was given first aid by villagers, and then transported to the military-run hospital in Leepa on a motorbike. Nearly two dozen villagers helped put out the fire that had engulfed the mosque.\nThe Pakistanis did not take long to get their act together and fired back from the remaining bunkers, pushing the Indian guns back from the ridges overlooking the valley.\nIn Dudhnial in Neelum valley, the action took place further up in the mountains, away from the village. A few villagers were awakened by gunfire.\nAn official familiar with what happened that morning said the Indians had advanced well beyond the LoC when their movements were detected.\n\"The Pakistani fire sent them scurrying back to their bunkers,\" he said.\nDown south, in Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber areas, it was more or less the same story: Indians coming forward from their positions on the LoC, taking unsuspecting Pakistani soldiers by surprise both due to the suddenness of the attack and the intensity of the fire and then pulling back once the Pakistanis had a chance to respond.\nUnprepared, and having a numerical disadvantage generally, the Pakistanis made use of their firepower to the fullest, exhausting their ammunition.\nLocals said that in the days following the attack, hundreds of villagers were pressed into service carrying artillery shells and other ammunition to border posts to replenish their supplies.\nKashmir-focused militants have had a strong presence in Pakistani-administered Kashmir for years. During the 1990s they crossed the LoC in droves to ambush troops on India\'s side.\nTheir activities became less visible after the 2003 ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, but their proficiency in suicide raids and other attacks kept them relevant to Pakistan\'s strategy in its dispute with India, despite denials from Pakistan\'s military.\nThe militants continue to maintain safe houses in bigger cities like Muzaffarabad, located some distance from the border area.\nBut they now mostly set up camps near military deployments along the LoC and away from villages where there is a growing sense of fatigue among locals towards the insurgency.\nDespite the claims in the Indian media, the BBC could find little evidence that militants had been hit.\nThere were no reports of any of the camps in the Samahni area of Bhimber or in the Poonch-Kotli area having been hit. They are mostly located behind ridges that serve as a natural barrier against direct Indian fire.\nIn Leepa, some five or six wooden structures housing militants between the villages of Channian and Mundakali had not been targeted. A ridge that runs along the east bank of the nearby stream covers them from military positions on the LoC.\nLikewise, in Neelum, most militant camps - such as the ones at Jhambar, Dosut and in the Gurez valley area further east - are located in the valleys below, at a safe distance from the LoC.\nThe BBC also could not confirm an Indian media report that Lashkar-e-Taiba camps in the Khairati Bagh village of Leepa valley and the western end of Dudhnial village in Neelum valley had been hit on 29 September.\nHowever, in Dudhnial some locals who helped carry military munitions to forward posts the weekend following the Indian strikes said they had seen one or two damaged structures close to a Pakistani post near the border. They thought those structures might have been hit on the morning of 29 September.\nBut they were reluctant to discuss whether those structures had been occupied by militants, or whether five or six men had died there, as the Indian media had claimed.\nThe BBC asked the Pakistani military about militant activity in the area, but there was no immediate response.\nSince 29 September there has been no let up in tension in the LoC area.\nLocals in Leepa told the BBC that following the attack, there had been an increased influx of militants in the valley. Are they in the area to help the army in case border skirmishes with the Indians get worse? No one is sure. \nIn Neelum, a top official of the district administration called a meeting and advised locals earlier this month to start digging bunkers in or near their houses in case border tensions escalate.\nA local school teacher who was  at the meeting said the official was told that removing militants from the area would be a simpler and less costly option to protect villages from Indian shelling.\nThe strategy was a confidential matter, the official responded. It would be up to the government to decide.\nDisputed Kashmir profiled\nConcern over Kashmir police\'s pellet guns', ' Kashmir Kashmir Islamabad Ilyas Khan Kashmir Line Control Pakistani Mundakali Neelum Khwaja Asif Kashmir Leepa Fire Leepa Mundakali Leepa Indians Kotli Bhimber Pakistanis Locals Samahni Channian Mundakali Jhambar Dosut Gurez Khairati Bagh Leepa Neelum Pakistani Pakistani Leepa Kashmir', '23 10 2016'),

But a BBC investigation found little evidence militants had been hit. \nThe bomber used a vehicle packed with explosives to ram a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian security forces on the heavily guarded Srinagar-Jammu highway about 20km (12 miles) from the capital, Srinagar. \nThe bomber is reported to be Adil Dar, a high school dropout who left home in March 2018. He is believed to be between the ages of 19 and 21. \nSoon after the attack, Jaish-e-Mohammad released a video in which a young man identified as Dar spoke about what he described as atrocities against Kashmiri Muslims. He said he had joined the group in 2018 and was eventually \"assigned\" the task of carrying out the attack in Pulwama. \nHe also said that by the time the video was released he would be in jannat (heaven). \nDar is one of many young Kashmiri men who have been radicalised in recent years. On Thursday, main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that the number of Kashmiri men joining militancy had risen from 88 in 2016 to 191 in 2018. \nIndia has been accused of using brutal tactics to put down protests in Kashmir - with thousands of people sustaining eye injuries from pellet guns used by security forces.\nby Arvind Chhabra, BBC News Punjabi\n\"I\'m proud of my son.

(137, 'The stolen childhoods of Kashmir in pencil and crayon', '\nThese are pictures of loss of childhood and innocence. They speak about a violent world outside shuttered homes. They reveal the terrors of the present and the fears for the future.\nThe colours are vivid. Red dominates, in blood and fire. Black is an ascendant colour, clouding the skies and scorching the earth. It\'s not dark yet, but it\'s getting there.\nThe artwork is by schoolchildren in Indian-administered Kashmir, home to one of the world\'s most protracted conflicts. These days, they mostly depict childhoods ruined by the violence of adults.\nThe meadows, streams, orchards and mountains that make their home \"heaven on earth\", as a Mughal emperor once exulted, is missing in much of their work. Stone-throwing protesters, gun-toting troops, burning schools, rubble-littered streets, gunfights and killings are some of the anxious, recurring themes on the canvas. \nLast summer was one of the bloodiest in the region for years. Following the killing of influential militant Burhan Wani by Indian forces in July, more than 100 civilians died in clashes with security forces during a four-month-long lockdown in the Muslim dominated-valley.\nSecurity forces fired metal pellets from shotguns into protesting crowds, leaving many blinded. More than 1,200 children below the age of 15 were among some 9,000 people injured in the protests. Most of them, according to reports, were \"young, [and] were either blinded completely or lost their vision in one eye\".\nAs violence spread on the street, schools shut. Children stayed indoors for months, drowning in the noise of TV news. At other times, they read and drew. They missed their friends and cricket games. Teachers gave lessons at home, and parents invigilated during home exams. One school even held an exam in a small indoor stadium.\nWhen the schools reopened in the winter, teachers found many of the students irate, nervous and uncertain. They were children of government workers, businessmen, doctors, engineers, bankers and farmers.\nThey came looking \"pale, like zombies\", the principal of a leading school told me. \nThey cried and hugged each other. Having spent months cooped up in their homes in near-captivity, they asked their teachers why they had closed the school. Some of them behaved strangely. They screamed without any reason, banged the tables and broke furniture. Counsellors were called in to calm them down. \n\"There was anger, a lot of anger,\" the principal said.\nThen, some 300 of them went to a school hall and sat down with paper and pastels. And they drew furiously.\n\"That\'s all they did on the first day. They drew what they wanted. They didn\'t utter a word. It was all very cathartic.\"\nThe children drew mostly in pastel and pencil. Many wrote over their pictures, using speech bubbles, headlines and sentences.\nIn many of their pictures, the valley is on fire, and streets are littered with the black detritus of rioting against an incongruent backdrop of a blazing sun and birds in the skies. \nThen there are young faces scarred and eyes blinded by pellets. It is a recurring, heart-wrenching theme. \n\"I cannot see the world again and cannot see my friends again. I am blind,\" says the subject of one such haunting image.\nChildhood is the kingdom where nobody dies, as a poet wrote, but in Kashmir, children have lived in the shadow of death for as long as one can remember. There are bodies lying on the street, and there are people on fire in the paintings.\n\"These are the mountains of Kashmir. And here\'s a school for kids. On the left are army men and opposite them are stone-throwing protesters who are demanding freedom,\" said a schoolboy in Anantnag, explaining his drawing.\n\"When protesters throw stones at the army, the army opens fire at them. In the crossfire, a school kid dies and his friend is left alone.\" \nThe other recurring theme - and nightmare - is the burning down of schools. There\'s a powerful picture of children trapped in a school on fire, screaming, \"help us, help us. Save our school, save us, save our future\". \nOthers are angrier and more political. \nThere are drawings with pro-freedom graffiti, and signposts which say Save our Kashmir in pastels. Others extol Burhan Wani, and resonate with anti-India slogans. There are maps of Kashmir oozing red.\nIn another village in southern Kashmir, a prominent artist found children drawing Indian flags fluttering on top of their houses. \nA scowling face of a man split into two is a metaphor for the bitter and festering rivalry between India and Pakistan, and the tragedy of a land sandwiched between the rival neighbours. \nThere\'s a heart-breaking pencil drawing of a mother waiting for her son. The children also vent their frustration over the shutdown of internet and mobile phone services during the protests.\nFive years ago, Australian art therapist Dena Lawrence conducted some art lessons with young people in the valley.  She found black was the predominant colour in their paintings, and most of them reflected \"anger, rage and depression\".\nKashmiri artist Masood Hussain, who has been judging art competitions for children aged four to 16 for the past four decades, says their subjects have changed.\n\"They have gone from the serene to the violent,\" he tells me. \"They draw red skies, red mountains, lakes, flowers and houses on fire. They draw guns and tanks, fire-fights and people dying on the street.\" \nArshad Husain, a Srinagar-based psychiatrist, says the artwork of the children in the valley betrays their collective trauma.\n\"We think children are too young to understand. That\'s not true. They absorb and assimilate everything around them. They express it in their own way,\" he says.\n\"Mind you, most of this artwork is coming from children who stayed at home. Imagine the children on the streets who are closer to the violence.\"\nIt is all reminiscent of children\'s art inspired by 9/11: weeping children, the twin towers on fire and being yanked off the ground by Osama Bin Laden against a blood-red skyline, a scarred girl wearing an I Love New York T-shirt.\nIn Kashmir, where fairy tales quickly turn into nightmares, hope is not extinguished yet. \nLet our future be bright, make us educated, don\'t make this crisis a reason for darkness, pleads a girl in a drawing. It\'s never too late.\nIllustrations gathered from children in Indian-administered Kashmir', ' Kashmir Burhan Wani Kashmir Kashmir Save Kashmir Burhan Wani Kashmir Kashmir Dena Lawrence Masood Hussain Arshad Osama Bin Laden', '29 5 2017');

Sameer Yasir reports how funerals in the region, which has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, have become a part of local folklore.\nAs the body of the militant, draped in green, is finally laid to rest, women sing songs of blood and valour. The body is placed on a makeshift platform so mourners can get a good view. People raise their hands in reverence to touch the body. \nYoung men push through the jostling crowd to kiss the militant\'s forehead. Then they touch his feet and rub their hands on their body, as if performing a religious ritual.\nThe crowd swells with every passing minute. Slogans of defiance rent the air. A group of teenagers grab the microphone, exhorting mourners to continue their \"struggle\" by singing songs of defiance. The \"celebrations\" continue till the body is buried in the \"martyrs\' graveyard\". \nOne recent afternoon in April, a lean old woman, with deep sunken eyes and grey hair, turned up at the funeral for a militant who had been killed in a gun battle the day before. She had a green polythene bag under her arm.\n\"I have come to say goodbye to my son,\" Zoona Begum announced in a thin voice to mourners at the funeral of 19-year-old Ubaid Shafi Malla, who had dropped out of college and joined a separatist group, the Hizbul Mujahideen, in February 2017.\nThough she was not Malla\'s biological mother, she said she had breastfed him when he was an infant.\nWearing a velvet pheran, a traditional Kashmiri cloak, she had walked more than 7km (four miles) in a pair of withered plastic sandals to the funeral in Trenz village of Shopian in southern Kashmir.\nShe had criss-crossed apple orchards to avoid detection by forces manning streets to stop angry supporters of militants from attending the funeral.\nThe crowd lifted her onto their shoulders and carried her to Malla\'s bullet-riddled body.\nOnce there, she kissed his bullet-pocked, deformed face, took a handful of candies from the bag and threw them on his body, a tradition observed when Kashmiri grooms return home with their brides.\nShe then addressed the crowd.\n\"Would you like to become a police officer?\" she began, to which the angry crowd chanted back \"No, we won\'t!\"\n\"Would you like to become a militant?\" she continued.\n\"Yes, we will,\" the crowd roared in response.\n\"Would you like to become Tiger?\" she said, pointing to a nearby village where a famous Kashmiri militant Sameer Bhat, also known as Sameer Tiger, was killed the previous week. \n\"Yes, we want to!\" the crowd responded.\n\"Then say it loudly,\" she shouted.\n\"Azadi! (freedom),\" the crowd responded.\nThe woman got down from the platform and disappeared into the crowd.   \nThis was one among the two dozen funerals this correspondent has covered in the last three years, almost all of them in five districts of south Kashmir.\nThe younger generation of Kashmiris, brought under the shadow of the gun, are joining the militant insurgency in numbers not seen in more than a decade. These young men now risk their lives in front of live bullets to save their \"role models\" - militants fighting against Indian rule.\nThey stand in front of Indian army vehicles and throw stones at them. They block roads and by lanes when rebels are cornered by security forces. Then they throw stones at them. In the process, many of them have been killed - more than 30 this year alone. \nMilitant leader Burhan Wani\'s death in a gun battle with government forces in July 2016 sparked a spiral of deadly violence in the Muslim-majority valley. \nWhen his close friend and militant Saddam Padder died recently, his funeral was attended by thousands of people. It was perhaps the second biggest funeral after that of Wani. \nOne of those killed in that gunfight was a sociologist from Kashmir University who was killed less than 40 hours after joining the group.\nDuring these endless funerals, more young men are inspired to join the militants. Most of them were born after the inception of the insurgency in 1989. They are the children of conflict.   \nOne 17-year-old boy, Zubair Ahmad, had evaded six checkpoints meant to stop people from attending Padder\'s funeral.\nThis was the 16th funerals of a Kashmiri militant he has attended in the last two years.\nHe watched as a group of militants with AK-47s in one hand and sticks in another, to keep people at a distance because of the fan-like adulation they receive, arrived at the funeral to offer a \"gun salute\" to their fallen comrade.\nPadder\'s mother kissed the forehead of one of the rebels, telling the mourners he was her \"other son\".\n\"One day they will drag India out of Kashmir,\" she shouted. The crowd responded with slogans against India.\nAfter the gun salute, the crowd cheered. But Mr Ahmad wept because he failed to get closer to the militants.    \nThe teenager was arrested last year after his pictures appeared on Facebook along with a militant during one of these funerals. Mr Ahmad said his career is \"over\" because of the multiple police cases against him, rendering him unsuitable for government jobs.\n\"One day, you will see me holding an AK-47 and firing like this in the air,\" Mr Ahmad said ominously.\n\"Then you will recall my words.\"\nSameer Yasir is an independent journalist based in Srinagar, Kashmir.', ' Kashmir Sameer Zoona Begum Shafi Malla Hizbul Mujahideen Malla Kashmir Malla Tiger Sameer Bhat Sameer Tiger Kashmir Kashmiris Burhan Wani Saddam Padder Kashmir University Zubair Ahmad Padder Ahmad Facebook Ahmad Ahmad Sameer Yasir Kashmir', '14 5 2018'),

She says the crew was given permission by the jail authorities and the ministry of home affairs. \nActivist Kavita Krishnan wondered how Udwin was allowed access to convicts inside jail when authorities \"prevent most human rights campaigners in India from speaking to, let alone filming, prisoners\".\nThe hour-long film also includes extensive interviews of the victim\'s parents, families of the convicts and their lawyers, interspersed with reconstruction of the incident.\nMukesh Singh, who is facing the death penalty along with three others, expressed no remorse and blamed the victim for fighting back.\nTimes Now news channel promptly took the lead in whipping up a campaign against the film, which it has described as \"voyeuristic\" and against \"all norms of journalism\".\nSome media analysts believe this has more to do with the channel\'s rivalry with NDTV, which had the rights to broadcast the film.\nCritics of the film have variously accused it of glorifying the rapist by giving him a platform, encouraging copycat crimes, or prejudicing the appeals of the rapists and spurring demands to fast-track their executions.\nOthers have been outraged that Indian audiences have been \"exposed to the remarks of such a brutal man\" on prime-time news. Although, it has to be said, Indians are accustomed to some pretty shocking stuff on prime-time news.\nA Delhi court has blocked the film \"until further orders\" after police said Mukesh Singh\'s \"offensive and derogatory remarks\" were \"creating an atmosphere of fear and tension with the possibility of public outcry and law and order situation\". \nA cynical friend suggests most of this outcry and potential danger to the law and order situation is confined to the TV studios and social media.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh has promised an inquiry into how the prison authorities gave permission to the film-maker and said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the interview. \nSome say India has sadly become a country of bans - films, books, and in a recent case, even beef. \nIt is not clear though whether the film\'s ban was provoked by a touchy Indian government led by the image-conscious Prime Minister Narendra Modi or because the home ministry was embarrassed. \nMany believe that the ban on the film hurts India\'s reputation most. \nWhen Mr Modi is trying hard to spruce up India\'s global image as a favoured destination to invest and visit, such ham-fisted and impulsive reactions cannot really help. \n\"It is patronising to control what people see about their own country,\" an American artist said on my Twitter timeline.\n\"Nobody sensible is suggesting banning the film,\" says writer Salil Tripathi. \"That is wrong\". \nBut the more things change, the more they remain the same. \nSenior minister Venkaiah Naidu talks about a \"conspiracy to defame India\" and says the \"country will be harmed if Ms Udwin\'s documentary is broadcast outside India\".  \nMany believe India\'s image will be harmed because India\'s government is not seen to be supportive of free speech, and not because of Mukesh Singh\'s odious remarks. \nWhy don\'t they let Indians watch the film and make up their minds about it? Why can\'t the state be less paternalistic?

But police in India secured a court injunction late on Tuesday, blocking the broadcast in India.\nThe Delhi court order also prevents publication of the interview, which has angered many in India.\nThe Delhi rape shocked the world. Four men were sentenced to hang for raping and murdering a 23-year-old student in 2012. The court injunction against the broadcast of the film in which one of the convicts is showing no remorse and is blaming the victim for fighting back has brought the story back to the fore.\nIt was the topic of studio discussions across several TV channels on Tuesday night. Times Now, which is known for being direct in its opinions, questioned the BBC and NDTV\'s decision to run the documentary.\n\"No right thinking Indian will waste his time in watching the interview... My point is you are saying that we want to reform the society by putting out the interview of a rapist, where he defames the victim. What form of journalism is this. I, too, am a journalist. This is not journalism. This is journalism turned upside down. This is unethical,\" Times Now editor Arnab Goswami said on his show Newshour.\nSeveral papers have also picked up the story, highlighting that the content of the documentary has angered many people in India.\n\"The government decision came in the wake of the wide-spread protests against the defamatory comments made by the convict in the interview,\" says The New Indian Express.\nBut much of the media debate is about the ethics of journalism in India and around the world. \n\"This is totally unacceptable. We have to draw an ethical boundary. I do not understand why they are doing it [airing the interview],\" The Indian Express quotes women\'s rights activist Ranjana Kumari as saying.\nSome activist say the documentary may weaken the case in Indian courts.\n\"Violation of the judicial process doesn\'t help the rape victim\'s case. I also find the ethics of launching a campaign on gender violence in India without holding a conversation with those involved in the Indian women\'s movement problematic\", Kavita Krishnan is quoted as saying in The Times of India.\nSome commentators, however, are backing the documentary, describing it as important research to fight gender crime.\nThe First Post says that most people already knew about the brutality of the convicts and should not be surprised by what one of them said in the interview.\n\"His statements, brazenly unrepentant, have caused a great furore of outrage on social media. But then he was part of a group of thugs who repeatedly brutalised a young woman... Did we still need additional proof of his bestiality? Or is it somehow more real because it now comes with a BBC certification?\nKiran Bedi, activist-turned politician, who was a chief ministerial candidate in the recently contested Delhi elections, expressed support for such documentaries in a show on NDTV.\n\"I would like to see every rapist, once convicted, to be interviewed. I would like to endorse this completely...Unless you know the cause of the crime, how will you correct it? How will you prevent it?\", she said. \n\"We must encourage this kind of research and this documentation if we want mindsets to change\".\nSpeaking in parliament, noted film writer and MP Javed Akhtar welcomed the making of the film and said it would reveal how rapists think.\nFellow MP, Anu Aga, supported his view: \"The reality is what the man said reflects the views of many men in India. Why we are shying away from it? We are not confronting the issues. Suggesting death penalty is not the answer. We have to confront the issue that many men in India do not respect women. Every time a rape happens, the victim is blamed to have provoked the men. Let\'s be aware of the view and not pretend all is well.\" \nThe documentary has also been dominating social media discussions in India.\nHashtags #Nirbhayainsulted and #Indiasdaughter have been trending on Twitter.\nMost users have expressed anger over the documentary\'s content and feel Nirbhaya (The Fearless one - a name given to the victim by the media) has been \"insulted\".\nSome users, however, felt it was important to talk about the issue and know what these men actually think about women\'s rights. \nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

She peeped out of the window and a Central Reserve Police Force [CRPF] man fired pellets at her from a very short range.\" \nBoth Ms Mushtaq\'s eyes have been severely damaged and Dr Tariq Qurashi, the head of ophthalmology at the hospital, told the BBC she would not regain her vision. \n\"We have received around 117 such cases,\" he said, adding that while seven people had been blinded by pellets, another 40 had been discharged with less serious eye injuries.\nPellet guns - a form of shotgun - were first used by the police as a non-lethal weapon to quell protests in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2010. They are usually used for hunting animals.\nThe gun fires a cluster of small, round-shaped pellets, which resemble iron balls, with high velocity. \nA pellet gun cartridge can contain up to 500 such pellets.  When the cartridge explodes, the pellets disperse in all directions. \nThey are less lethal than bullets but can cause serious injuries, especially if they hit the eye.\nDoctors treating pellet gun wounds in Kashmir told the Indian Express newspaper they were seeing \"sharp and more irregular-shaped pellets\" which were causing \"more damage\" this time. \nThe unrest in Kashmir this time has killed more than 40 people in the region and injured close to 1,800. \nThe government imposed a strict curfew but crowds of mainly young people have defied orders across the region, taking to the streets in large numbers. \nSecurity forces have been accused of using disproportionate force against civilians, a charge the state government has vowed to investigate.\nThey have fired bullets, tear gas, pepper gas and, of course, the \"non-lethal\" pellets at protesters. \nThey are meant to follow Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which calls for targeting legs in extreme volatile conditions. But more than 90% of those injured have received injuries above the waist. \nRajeshwar Yadav, a spokesman for the CRPF in Kashmir, has insisted that officers have shown \"maximum restraint\" while dealing with protesters. \n\"We use a special cartridge that has low impact and is non-lethal,\" Mr Yadav told the BBC.\nBut many disagree. \n\"Government forces are deliberately aiming at chests and heads,\" one doctor told the BBC on condition of anonymity. \"They seem to be aiming to kill.\"\nAt the Srinagar hospital where Miss Mushtaq was being treated, tales of pain and agony abounded.\nA nurse was examining Shabir Ahmad Dar, 17. Doctors feared that he might lose vision in his right eye.  \nIn a bed close to him, Aamir Fayaz Ganai, 16, told the BBC, \"I was on the way to my friend\'s home when something hit my eye very hard.\" \nMr Ganai was one of the luckier ones, though, as doctors believed they could save the eye. \nA team of three eye specialists has also been sent to Srinagar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a leading Delhi hospital.\nDr Sudarshan K Kumar, who led the team, said that the nature of the injuries was so severe that it was almost as if Kashmiri doctors were dealing with a \"war-like situation\". \nAnd the trauma does not  stop there.\nThose who have to live with the impact of eye injuries and blindness often face financial hardship, trauma and depression.\nMany have to seek treatment outside Kashmir - expenses they cannot easily afford. And in most cases, the damage is irreversible. \nLike in the case of Aabid Mir, 15, who suffered severe eye injuries after being hit by pellets while returning home from the funeral of a militant. \nMr Mir\'s family had to rely on donations to treat him. They eventually took him to a hospital in Amritsar in Punjab state. \n\"His treatment cost us more than 200,000 rupees [$2,979; £2,245],\" he told the BBC.\nHayat Dar was completing the final year of his undergraduate degree in 2013 when he was hit by pellets.\n\"I had to go through more than five vitreo-retinal surgeries,\" he said. \"I was completely blind for more than a year before I regained slight vision in my left eye.

They immediately put the blame on Pakistan without investigation,\" foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria told the BBC.\nBut Mr Singh said on Twitter that \"there are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped\".\n\"I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan\'s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,\" he said.\nUK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson condemned the attack and said the UK \"stands shoulder to shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism, and in bringing the perpetrators to justice\".\nBoth India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but only control parts of it.\nIndian army military operations head Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh said there was evidence the attackers were members of an Islamist militant group in Pakistan.\nThe terrorists had some items which had Pakistani markings on,\" he said.\nKashmir profile\nThe militants infiltrated across the Line of Control from Pakistan before attacking the base, west of Srinagar, an army officer told the BBC.\nGunfire and explosions were heard for several hours.\nMany tents and temporary shelters caught fire during the attack, according to the army\'s Northern Command.\nTwelve soldiers were killed by fires and the others died in gun battles, the Hindustan Times reports, citing army sources.\nDisputed Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 60 years, causing two wars between the neighbours.\nA militant attack on an army camp in Uri in December 2014 saw at least nine members of the security forces killed. \nThe last attack of this scale on the Indian army was in June 2015 in Manipur, north-east India, when at least 20 soldiers were killed in an attack on a troop convoy.\nWith the Indian Home Ministry talking about a \"cross-border terror attack\", there is no doubt the raid  will make the already fraught relations between India and Pakistan even frostier. \nBut the truth is this latest upsurge in violence has a distinctly home-grown flavour.\nThe huge wave of protests against Indian rule that were prompted by the killing of a popular young militant on 8 July have been overwhelmingly by people from Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir. \nThe attack is likely to mean normal life in the province will continue to be paralysed by the curfew imposed by the security forces for some time to come.\nThe Indian government says it wants to discuss how to end the violence with local leaders, but so far its overtures have been rejected by separatists who insist that the issue of Kashmiri independence must be on the table.', ' Militants Kashmir Uri Line Control Pakistan Rajnath Singh Nafees Zakaria Singh Twitter Uri Boris Johnson Ranbir Singh Line Control Pakistan Hindustan Times Kashmir Uri Indian Home Ministry Kashmir Kashmiri', '18 9 2016'),
(143, 'Injured baby refuels India Kashmir pellet gun debate', '\nThe plight of a 19-month-old child who suffered severe eye injuries after being hit by a pellet gun fired by security forces has renewed anger in Indian-administered Kashmir. Sameer Yasir reports. \nWhen Heeba Jan returned from hospital to her home in south Kashmir\'s Shopian district on Tuesday, curious neighbours, many of them small children, had gathered to see the \"youngest victim\" of pellet-induced eye injuries.\n\"What has happened to you, my doll,\" Amina Rather, a neighbour said to Heeba, as she planted a kiss on her red cheeks. \n\"Leave me,\" Heeba cried, trying to rub her injured right eye with her small hands. Her mother, Marsala Jan, pushed her hands away.  \nMinutes later, her mother declared to the room full of visitors that her daughter was due for more eye surgery on Wednesday. Her announcement was met with grief-filled sighs and prayers for recovery.\nDoctors say Heeba will need many operations. \n\"We can only assess her damaged eye after a second surgery,\" Saleem Tak, the head of the ophthalmology department of the hospital that treated Heeba, told the BBC. \nThere is a chance that she may lose most of the vision in that eye.\nImages of the injuries caused to the 19-month-old girl have renewed public anger in the Muslim-majority region, which has seen violence since the late 1980s when separatists began waging a violent campaign against Indian rule.\nKashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan but both countries only control parts of it. India blames Pakistan for fuelling unrest in the region, a claim denied by Islamabad.\nThe widespread use of pellet guns against protesters in recent years has led to an estimated 3,000 people in the region sustaining eye injuries - locals call it a \"dead eye epidemic\". \nDespite the public anger, Indian security forces have stepped up their use of pellet guns.\nOn Sunday, Heeba was playing in her home with her elder brother when locals from her village clashed with Indian forces going after six separatist rebels trapped in the nearby village of Kapran. The rebels were later killed.  \nAs the number of protesters swelled, the area reverberated with anti-India slogans and security forces fired tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.\nThe clashes moved to within a few hundred metres from the entrance of Heeba Jan\'s house. \n \"I was preparing breakfast when I started coughing furiously. Greyish smoke from the tear gas shells had entered the house. Every passing minute made the air more unbreathable,\" said her mother, who was alone in the house with her two children. \"Heeba started vomiting and my five-year-old son was struggling to breathe.\" \nAs the condition of her children worsened, Ms Jan took Heeba in her arms, held the hand of her son, Shahdat, and ran outside, only to find herself trapped in the middle of the chaos.\n\"I saw forces firing towards us, so I pulled my son behind me and covered Heeba\'s face with my hand,\" Ms Jan told the BBC.  \nThree pellets fired by a soldier in her direction hit Ms Jan\'s hand but one still perforated Heeba\'s right eye.\n\"Muma, tout [mother, it\'s burning],\" Heeba screamed, blood oozing out of her eye. Ms Jan then passed out.  \nShe only regained consciousness while travelling in an ambulance from her village to a hospital in the state capital Srinagar and saw her neighbours surrounding her.  \n\"Mein tche dag [I am in pain],\" Heeba consistently told her mother in broken toddler language. While at the hospital, her mother would often break down, walking from one corner of the ward to another. She had even got a packet of candies, her daughter\'s favourite, but Heeba refused them, asking everyone to leave her alone.\nThe State Human Rights Commission has registered 3,800 cases of pellet injuries and blinding since 2016, \"but there are hundreds who, because of the fear of [security] forces, don\'t register themselves at all,\" Mohammad Ashraf Wani, the head of Pellet Victims Welfare Trust (PVWT), an informal group of pellet victims, told the BBC.\nMr Wani, 28, who sports a dishevelled beard and furrowed brow, says most of the 1,233 victims registered with his organisation have talked about taking their lives because they have gone blind.\n \"They get irritated. They don\'t want to hear noise. They want to be left alone,\" said Mr Wani, who was also blinded in his right eye by a pellet gun. \nFor two days, Heeba, who does not understand what has happened to her, wanted to remove the padding on her eye.\nHer father, 40-year-old Nasir Ahmad, is a labourer and he was working in an orchard some distance away from his home when the incident took place.\n \"I wish the pellet had hit me, not you, my life,\" he said, hugging his daughter. \nThe incident has generated massive outrage. It created headlines in India as well as in neighbouring Pakistan, with many questioning anew, the need for pellet guns. In Pakistan it was showcased as \"another\" instance of India\'s \"brutality\" in the region.\nIn Kashmir, social media is full of angry rants against the security forces. \n\"People might not remember or write about her, but we will remember what India does to us,\" Sauf-ud-Jan, Heeba\'s uncle, told the BBC, as a 15-year-old boy, whose left eye was hit by pellets in the same incident, nodded his head.', ' Kashmir Sameer Heeba Jan Kashmir Amina Rather Heeba Heeba Marsala Jan Heeba Saleem Tak Heeba Kashmir Islamabad Heeba Kapran Heeba Jan Heeba Jan Shahdat Heeba Jan Jan Heeba Muma Heeba Jan Srinagar Mein Heeba Heeba Mohammad Ashraf Wani Pellet Victims Welfare Trust Heeba Nasir Ahmad Heeba', '28 11 2018'),
(144, 'Is India losing Kashmir?', '\nAs India\'s most restive region stares down the abyss of what a commentator calls another \"hot summer of violence\", the doom-laden headline has returned with a vengeance: Is India losing Kashmir? \nLast summer was one of the bloodiest in the Muslim-dominated valley in recent years. Following the killing of influential militant Burhan Wani by Indian forces last July, more than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes during a four-month-long security lockdown in the valley.\nIt\'s not looking very promising this summer. \nThis month\'s parliamentary election in Srinagar was scarred by violence and a record-low turnout of voters. To add fuel to the fire, graphic social videos surfaced claiming to show abuses by security forces and young people who oppose Indian rule. A full-blown protest by students has now erupted on the streets; and, in a rare sight, even schoolgirls are throwing stones and hitting police vehicles. \nChief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who leads an awkward ruling coalition with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), rushed to Delhi on Monday to urge the federal government to \"announce a dialogue and show reconciliatory gestures\". \nReports say Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh told her that they could not \"offer a dialogue with separatists and other restive groups in the valley\" while fierce violence and militant attacks continued.\nFormer chief minister and leader of the regional National Conference party Farooq Abdullah warned India that it was \"losing Kashmir\". What Mr Abdullah suggested was unexceptionable: the government should begin talking with the stakeholders - Pakistan, the separatists, mainstream parties, the minority Kashmiri Hindus - and start \"thinking of not a military solution, but a political way\".\nWith more than 500,000 security forces in the region, India is unlikely to lose territory in Kashmir. But Shekhar Gupta, a leading columnist, says that while Kashmir is \"territorially secure, we are fast losing it emotionally and psychologically\". The abysmal 7% turnout in the Srinagar poll proved that \"while your grip on the land is firm, you are losing its people\". \nSo what is new about Kashmir that is worrying India and even provoking senior army officials to admit that the situation is fragile? \nFor one, a more reckless and alienated younger generation of local youth is now leading the anti-India protests. More than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30. Many of them are angry and confused. \nAjaz, a 19-year-old student in Budgam, told me that hope had evaporated for his generation \"in face of Indian oppression\" and he and his friends did not \"fear death\".  When I took him aside after a while to ask about his ambitions in life, he said he wanted to become a bureaucrat and serve Kashmir.\n\"It is wrong to say that the Kashmiri youth has become fearless. He just feels alienated, sidelined and humiliated. When he feels like that, fear takes a backseat, and he becomes reckless. This is irrational behaviour,\" National Conference leader Junaid Azim Mattoo told me.\nSecondly, the new younger militants are educated and come from relatively well-off families. \nWani, the militant who was killed last July, headed a prominent rebel group and came from a  highly-educated upper-class Kashmiri family: his father is a government school teacher. Wani\'s younger brother, Khalid, who was killed by security forces in 2013, was a student of political science. The new commander of the rebel group, Zakir Rashid Bhat, studied engineering in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh.\nThirdly, the two-year-old ruling alliance, many say, has been unable to deliver on its promises. An alliance between a regional party which advocates soft separatism (PDP) and a federal Hindu nationalist party (BJP), they believe, makes for the strangest bedfellows, hobbled by two conflicting ideologies trying to work their way together in a contested, conflicted land. \nFourthly, the government\'s message on Kashmir appears to be backfiring. \nWhen Mr Modi recently said the youth in Kashmir had to choose between terrorism and tourism, many Kashmiris accused him of trivialising their \"protracted struggle\". When BJP general secretary Ram Madhav told a newspaper that his government \"would have choked\" the valley people if it was against them, many locals said it was proof of the government\'s arrogance. \nFifth, the shrill anti-Muslim rhetoric by radical Hindu groups and incidents of cow protection vigilantes attacking Muslim cattle traders in other parts of India could end up further polarising people in the valley. \"The danger,\" a prominent leader told me, \"is that the moderate Kashmiri Muslim is becoming sidelined, and he is being politically radicalised.\"\nThe security forces differ and say they are actually worried about rising \"religious radicalisation\" among the youth in the valley. A top army official in Kashmir, Lt-Gen JS Sadhu, told a newspaper that the \"public support to terrorists, their glorification and increased radicalisation are issues of concern\". \nOne army official told me that religious radicalisation was a \"bigger challenge than stone pelting protesters\". He said some 3,000 Saudi-inspired Wahhabi sect mosques had sprung up in Kashmir in the past decade. \nMost Kashmiris say the government should be more worried about \"political radicalisation\" of the young, and that fears of religious radicalisation were exaggerated and overblown.\nAlso, the low turnout in this month\'s elections has rattled the region\'s mainstream parties. \"If mainstream politics is delegitimised and people refuse to vote for them, the vacuum will be obviously filled up with a disorganised mob-led constituency,\" Mr Mattoo of the National Conference said.\nIn his memoirs, Amarjit Singh Daulat, the former chief of India\'s spy agency RAW wrote that \"nothing is constant; least of all Kashmir\". But right now, the anomie and anger of the youth, and a worrying people\'s revolt against Indian rule, appear to be the only constants.', ' Kashmir Burhan Wani Indian Srinagar Mehbooba Mufti Delhi Narendra Modi Rajnath Singh Farooq Abdullah Kashmir Abdullah Kashmiri Hindus Kashmir Shekhar Gupta Kashmir Budgam Kashmir Kashmiri Junaid Azim Mattoo Wani Zakir Rashid Bhat Kashmir Kashmir Kashmiris Ram Madhav Kashmir Sadhu Kashmir Mattoo National Conference Amarjit Singh Daulat Kashmir', '26 4 2017'),

There was massive security in place. \nBut an election without voters is a very sad affair.\nI arrived at one polling station five hours after it had opened.

The polling centres was forced to close, hence the ballot today.\nI introduced myself and asked how things were going.\n\"We\'re hatching eggs here,\" laughed Ali Mohammad, one of the election officers. He meant they were sitting doing nothing.  \nWhen I asked why it was so quiet, he conceded that India\'s efforts to ensure there was no disruption this time round might well have put some voters off.\nKashmir is one of the most militarised region in the world - there are more personnel per capita here than in Iraq or Syria.  We\'d driven through streets lined with heavily armed officers to get here - one for every three eligible voters.\n\"Area domination\", the policeman in-charge called it, seemingly unconscious of how ominous his words sounded in a region many believe is on the brink of separatist revolt.\nBut back at the polling station, Mr Mohammad didn\'t think military muscle alone accounted for the lack of interest in the electoral process.\nWill it get any busier, I asked? He shook his head. \"We are ready for voters if they come, but it won\'t be busy here today,\" he told me, smiling gently.  \nThen he frowned, clearly unhappy with his fellow Kashmiris\' lack of engagement.  Mr Mohammad is a teacher by profession.  \n\"The right to vote is important,\" he said after a pause, \"it gives us the power to determine our own fate.\"\nHis words underscore just what an indictment of the mainstream Kashmiri parties the turnout on Sunday was when only 7% of the electorate bothered to vote.\nYes, separatists called for a boycott and yes, there were stone-throwing mobs at some polling stations, but if the electorate had been persuaded that politicians could deliver a brighter future, more would surely have made the effort to vote.\nThat was certainly the view of the group of young men I got talking to outside another of the polling centres that had been attacked.\nWhen I asked how many of them had been part of the stone-throwing mob, they shuffled nervously. Then 13, 14, 15 hands went up: half the group.\nThe justification was all too familiar - \"azadi\" or freedom.\nKashmiris have long dreamt of creating an independent nation up here in the bright green valleys of the Himalayas.  It\'s an ambition India has no intention of allowing.\nIn the 80s and 90s, a few thousand militants were at the vanguard of the independence struggle. There are far fewer now - perhaps 250 or so - but opposition to Indian rule appears to be becoming more widespread.\nIt is the reason the young men give for trying to disrupt the polls. \"All politicians are the same and none of them will bring freedom, so why vote?\" asked one.\nBut what is the alternative?  \nThe answer these young men gave doesn\'t augur well for Kashmir - or for India.

(155, 'Viewpoint: India and Pakistan up the ante on disputed border', '\nThe fragile peace along the de facto border dividing India and Pakistan in Kashmir is crumbling. \nThe Line of Control (LoC) is an un-demarcated 776km (482 mile) stretch of frontier that snakes across the mountains of the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. \nAbout 200,000 Indian and Pakistani soldiers face each other here, with rifles, machine guns, mortars and artillery at the ready. It is the most intensively manned and militarised border in the world.\nSkirmishes between soldiers and artillery duels were a regular feature of the LoC until it fell silent in 2003, when former Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and former president of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf agreed to an unwritten peace. \nThat ceasefire has come under growing pressure since 2013, when both sides resumed a deadly game of sneaking across the LoC, killing enemy soldiers and taking body parts for trophies.\nIndia says that Pakistani soldiers violate the ceasefire to facilitate infiltration by separatist Kashmiri and Pakistani militants who cross the LoC in both directions - from the Indian side to get arms and training in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir; and back to the Indian side to fight security forces in the Kashmir valley. \nTo facilitate this infiltration, Pakistani soldiers open intense fire at Indian posts to keep soldiers\' heads down. That provides an opportunity for small groups of militants to thread their way across no-man\'s land, scale a formidable Indian border fence and then cross through minefields laid between Indian posts. \nThe Indian Army says Pakistan violated the ceasefire 860 times in 2017, with December alone accounting for 147 violations, the most in any year since the November 2003 ceasefire. Firing has continued in the new year, with January seeing stepped up violations. \nCeasefire violations have doubled over previous years. India says there were 405 violations in 2015 and 449 in 2016.\nPakistan counters that Indian troops violated the ceasefire more than 1,900 times last year. It says there have been more than 75 violations this January alone.\nIt is hard to apportion responsibility for ceasefire violations. \nBoth sides say their troops encounter \"unprovoked fire\" which draws an \"appropriate response\". \nSince no impartial observers monitor the LoC in any serious way - the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) visits the LoC only occasionally, and never without warning - it is impossible to accurately verify claims.\nIn a departure from the norm, Indian army chief Bipin Rawat admitted on 12 January that Indian troops were violating the ceasefire to punish Pakistani posts for supporting infiltration by militants. \n\"Earlier, we were targeting only infiltrating militants [on the LoC]. But these extremists are disposable commodities for Pakistan. Instead, the pain has to be felt by the Pakistan armed forces for supporting infiltration. So we have started targeting (Pakistani) posts and I can assure you that, in these exchanges of fire, he has suffered three-four times the casualties. That is why we get repeated requests from Pakistan to take the ceasefire back to 2003 levels,\" Gen Rawat told reporters.\nGiven India\'s tough stance, there is little prospect of early de-escalation. \nIn early January,  India\'s army rebuffed a Pakistani request for the two directors general of military operations (DGMO) to meet and discuss de-escalation on the LoC. \nWhile the DGMOs speak every week over a dedicated hotline, a meeting is a rare event directed at solving a serious problem. \nThe last DGMO meeting took place at Wagah on Christmas Eve 2013, and succeeded in de-escalating a similar rash of ceasefire violations that had flared on the LoC after Pakistani troops killed seven Indian soldiers and mutilated the bodies of two.\nThis time, however, the Indian army chief has made the return of calm conditional on Pakistan ending support to infiltration. Gen Rawat said: \"If we see a drop in infiltration along the LoC we are willing to call for a ceasefire, but not until we see a drop in infiltration levels.\"\nSince Pakistan is unlikely to completely block militant infiltration into Kashmir, low-level conflict could continue on the LoC. \nOver decades, both armies have learned how to calibrate violence without letting it escalate into more serious fighting. \nSince both sides occupy heavily defended positions, skirmishes invariably end in stalemates with no capture of significant territory by either side - which would be the only realistic trigger for an escalation of fighting.\nIndia and Pakistan have fought three wars and a limited conflict - all but one were over Kashmir. The two countries  formalised the ceasefire line as the Line of Control as part of a new resolve to negotiate differences after their 1971 war which ended in Bangladesh splitting from Pakistan. \nA full peace, however, has proved elusive.\nAjai Shukla is a Delhi-based columnist on strategic affairs, defence and diplomacy', ' Jammu Kashmir Pakistan Pervez Musharraf Kashmiri Pakistani Kashmir Bipin Rawat Pakistani Wagah Christmas Rawat Kashmir Line Control Ajai Shukla', '30 1 2018'),

The hanging of Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri separatist convicted over the 2001 Indian parliament attack, also intensified anger and a sense of isolation. \nThe final straw in recent times, seems to be the decision by the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), which won elections in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, to form a coalition with India\'s ruling Hindu nationalist BJP which performed well in the neighbouring Hindu majority region of Jammu.\nPolice records confirm that some of the young men who have recently become militants had actively canvassed for the PDP in the 2014 general elections. \nAnalysts in the area say that the absence of political engagement to resolve the Kashmir dispute is setting a new political discourse and militancy is gaining legitimacy among people who believe Delhi is ignoring political realities.\nThe question that is being asked now, is if Wani is more dangerous to India now that he is dead.\nThe challenge the government now faces is fighting the ideology that Wani promoted, clearly reflected in the outpouring of sentiment over his killing. \nShujaat Bukhari is the editor of Rising Kashmir newspaper, Srinagar', ' Burhan Wani Kashmir Shujaat Bhukari Burhan Wani Wani Wani Kashmir Wani Wani Kashmir Afzal Guru People Hindu Jammu Kashmir Delhi Wani Wani Shujaat Kashmir', '11 7 2016'),
(159, 'Why a cricket match caused student unrest in Kashmir', '\nTensions remain high at a university in Indian-administered Kashmir following a row sparked by a cricket match. Students and police clashed at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Srinagar city, with police using sticks to beat up students. Senior journalist Shujaat Bukhari explains the incident and what has happened so far. \nNIT was founded as a regional engineering college in 1960 and was under the control of the Kashmiri state government until 2004 when it was renamed and taken over by the federal government\'s ministry of human resource development (HRD). \nThis meant that admission to the college began to be based on a national examination, open to students from across India. \nThis has gradually changed the composition of students in the institute. \nAt present, 50% of the university seats are reserved for students from outside the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The other 50% is divided between students from the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh regions.\nNearly 3,000 students currently study on the campus.\nThe crisis began during India\'s World Twenty20 semi-final clash against the West Indies last week. \nReports said that local Kashmiri students supported the West Indies, while all the others cheered for the home team.\nWhat began as slogan-shouting soon turned violent and clashes broke out. \nA few Kashmiri students told local media that they had been \"thrashed\" in the incident. This led to anger within the Kashmir Valley, made worse by a report by a courier boy named Imtiyaz Sheikh, who complained that \"outsider\" students beat him up when he went to deliver a package at the campus.\nClashes broke out again when non-Kashmiri students chanted \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" (Victory for mother India) and attempted to hoist the Indian flag at the university.\nPolice intervened and allegedly \"seized\" the flag and attempted to restore order. \nIndia is currently witnessing a heated debate over the phrase because some Muslims say the line equates the country to a mother \"deity\" and worshipping any god, apart from Allah, is un-Islamic. \nA Muslim legislator in the western Indian state of Maharashtra was recently suspended after he refused to say it.\nThe non-Kashmiri students allege that they are now being harassed by the faculty, most of whom are locals. They said they tried to hold a protest march outside the campus, but were stopped by the police. \nClashes broke out between the two sides and led to police baton-charging the protesting students. \nControversy over a cricket match in Kashmir is not new.\nMany in the valley have regularly cheered for Pakistan. In fact, before the outbreak of militancy in the region in the late 1980s, residents would publicly cheer for teams like Australia and West Indies.\nAnd now, with anti-India sentiment running high and with many Kashmiris feeling alienated, such outbursts are not unusual. \nPolice and unofficial university sources have maintained that the violence was nothing more than a group of senior students trying to settle old scores.\nBut some students, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said they felt threatened. \n\"We are not safe and we are too afraid to study. The faculty is not good to us and we are scared of the police,\" one of them said. \nThe local students allege that the entire incident is a ruse to shift the NIT out of Kashmir.\n\"We are a minority in the campus.

(160, 'Why the Kashmir killings could have been avoided', '\nWhen security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir killed a prominent militant leader in a gunfight last week, they would have surely anticipated a civilian blowback in the Muslim-dominated valley. \nAfter all, the young, social-media savvy Burhan Wani had become the mascot of a new generation of home-grown rebels fighting Indian rule in the region - there are close to 100 local militants in Kashmir today, four times as many as in 2011, Indian intelligence estimates. Wani\'s ability to \"recruit [people] into militancy from the grave will far outstrip anything he could have done on social media,\" tweeted Kashmir\'s former chief minister and opposition leader Omar Abdullah after the killing.\nYet, when Kashmir predictably erupted in fury over the killing, a familiar, bloody script played out once again. \nFive days of clashes between protesters and security forces following Wani\'s killing have left at least 36 people dead and some 1,500 people, mostly aged 16-26, wounded. The curfew entered its fifth day on Wednesday, making this the worst siege the valley has faced since two popular uprisings in 2008 and 2010 in which 200 people, mostly civilian protesters, died in clashes with the security forces. \nMany believe last weekend again saw security forces using excessive force as they tried to control the protests. Security personnel say they are forced to open fire in the face of dire mob provocation. But allegations that the forces are trigger happy in Kashmir have never gone away. \"The fact is that they used disproportionate force at the weekend, when the majority of deaths happened,\" says Shujaat Bukhari, editor of Rising Kashmir newspaper.\nSecurity experts say India\'s forces - army, paramilitary soldiers, border guards - are not equipped to handle civilian uprisings. Most are trained to fight a foreign enemy. Killing their own people in Kashmir, one of the world\'s most militarised regions, makes them look like an occupying force. The police does not inspire much confidence either in Kashmir, or anywhere else in India: the force is run on the basis of 155-year-old colonial law and has seen almost no reform.\nNearly two decades after the uprising began in the region, the security forces still appear to be totally out of their depth in the use of modern, non-lethal weapons of crowd control. There has been a lot of talk about using water cannons, the malodorous \"skunk\" spray, noise machines, for example. The forces have picked on using \"pellet guns\" - a kind of shot gun -  that have actually ended up causing serious eye injuries. Doctors say more than 100 people have received pellets in their eyes after the weekend clashes and it\'s feared that many may lose their eyesight.\nFor the remainder, the forces have been resorting to firepower and tear gas. More than 100 people injured in the latest violence are suffering from bullet wounds. \"Shoot to kill does not exactly help win the battle of hearts and minds in Kashmir,\" says one expert.\nThe Kashmir government - an uneasy marriage of convenience between the regional People\'s Democratic Party and the BJP - has promised that policemen and security forces will be \"made answerable\" for incidents where excessive force has been used at the weekend. \nNo-one in Kashmir believes that this will happen. There have been more than 20 official investigations into incidents of violence related to the insurgency in Kashmir since 1990, but the fate of the majority of them remains unknown. The previous government set up a probe after 120 people, mostly young civilian men, died in clashes with security forces in 2010. \"No-one was prosecuted. No-one was tried in court. There\'s 100% impunity for security forces in Kashmir,\" says human rights activist Khurram Parvez.\nThat is, of course, just one part of the seemingly intractable problem that is Kashmir. \nLast week\'s uprising again showed that without a political solution, the dispute in Kashmir will continue to fester. In a 2010 survey of Kashmiri attitudes, 81% of locals said the great problem was joblessness, while 68% spoke about corruption and 45% pointed to poor economic development. Still, 80% of them said the Kashmir dispute was \"very important\" to them. \nAnd as Stephen Cohen of the Brookings Institution says: \"Normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan would not make much of a difference if Kashmiri sentiments are not taken into account.\"\n\"We in India wasted so many years in containing the Kashmir militancy,\" writes Amarjit Singh Dulat, the former chief of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India\'s leading external intelligence agency, in his recent memoirs. \"And once it was contained, we sat back and were happy with the status quo, instead of taking advantage of the situation to forge a political solution.\" \nThere is no evidence that it will be any different this time.', ' Kashmir Burhan Wani Kashmir Wani Kashmir Omar Abdullah Kashmir Wani Kashmir Shujaat Bukhari Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Khurram Parvez Kashmir Kashmir Kashmir Stephen Cohen Brookings Kashmir Amarjit Singh Dulat Research Analysis', '14 7 2016'),

(163, 'Why the border in Kashmir is restive again', '\nTen years after India and Pakistan agreed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) that divides Kashmir between the two countries, mortars and shells are once again being exchanged on the disputed border. The BBC\'s Geeta Pandey reports from Poonch in Indian-administered Kashmir.\nThe fragile peace in Mohammad Deen\'s life was shattered on 22 August.\n\"My wife Noor Jaan had just stepped out of the house to water the buffaloes when a shell fell in front of her. As she turned around to escape it, the second one fell right behind her,\" he says.\nHer body riddled with shrapnel, she\'s now unable to move. Ever since the attack, the couple\'s two children have refused to go to school.\n\"They are petrified. They live in constant fear. They ask me not to step out, they think I will get hit too. But I don\'t have an option. I have to go out to till the land, look after the crops and take care of the buffaloes,\" Mohammad Deen says.\nThe family lives in the village of Keerni in Poonch district in Jammu region. Parts of the village are in Pakistan and the two sides are demarcated by a narrow stream. \nThe Indian part of Keerni is inside the fence the army built on the LoC some years ago to make it difficult for militants to cross over. Outsiders are not allowed to travel to Keerni so Mohammad Deen takes me to the mountains across the valley and from there points out the glistening metal roof of his home and the Indian army positions.\nLocked between the fence and the LoC, Mohammad Deen says the 120 families or 600 residents of Keerni are like sitting ducks for the incoming fire from across the border. \nBefore the November 2003 ceasefire, the village was shelled regularly, but since then a tenuous truce brought some respite to the residents along the 740km (460-mile) LoC. \nEvery now and then, the two sides exchanged fire, but this year the firing has been the heaviest in many years.\nSince January, the Indian army says, there have been nearly 100 instances of cross-border shelling and for the first time since 1999 when the two sides fought a limited war in Kargil, fire was exchanged in the region.\nIndia says six of its soldiers were killed and a number of civilians injured. Casualties have also been reported on the Pakistani side and both sides have accused each other of \"unprovoked aggression\".\nThe incessant shelling has created an atmosphere of fear in the areas along the disputed border. \nQ&A: Kashmir dispute\nShamsher Hussain, the senior-most police official in Poonch, says ceasefire violations by Pakistan have \"gone up a lot in the area, some people have been injured, there has been damage to property and cattle\".\n\"Shells have been falling once or twice every week. People are afraid, they can\'t work in the fields, can\'t take their cattle out,\" he says. \nShamim Dar, a social worker from Keerni who lives in Poonch town, says \"people are worried that the pre-2003 situation may return again\" .\nIt is difficult to say which side fired the first shot, but Mr Hussain believes the border has been volatile because the Pakistani army is trying to help militants sneak into Indian-held territory. \n\"It\'s a diversionary tactic, sometimes they fire at the army posts to keep them occupied so that a group of militants can cross the border.\"\nKashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over 60 years and, besides the Kargil conflict, the reason for two full-fledged wars.\nPakistan\'s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif says he wants peace with India amid expectations that he would meet PM Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week.\nPredictably, the latest trouble on the border threatens to derail the fledgling peace process between Delhi and Islamabad with many in India trying to dissuade PM Singh from meeting Mr Sharif.\nThe meeting is expected to go ahead and few expect the border skirmishes to lead to full-scale fighting, but many in Kashmir are worried that things may get worse.\nIn recent weeks, there have been threats from India-baiting militants in Pakistan like Syed Salahuddin that they would \"flood Kashmir with fighters\" once the US forces withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014.\nAlthough Abdul Ghani Mir, the inspector general of police in Srinagar, says \"whatever comes, we are ready to fight it\", the threats are causing some unease in India.\nThis year, there have been \"some high-profile attacks on the security forces and about a dozen village council members have been killed\", says Tahir Mohiuddin, chief editor of Srinagar-based Urdu newspaper Chattan.\n\"The situation is not as bad as it was at the peak of militancy in the 1990s, but after the quiet of the last few years, it appears the militants are regrouping and trying to revive militancy,\" he says.\nIn recent years, the two decade-long insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir, backed by Pakistan, has waned. \nAnd over the last decade, Delhi and Islamabad have worked on confidence-building measures by easing visa restrictions and allowing trade and people-to-people contacts. \nPoonch has been a big beneficiary of improved ties - in 2006, cross-border trade and travel was allowed and a weekly bus service was started between Poonch and the Pakistani town of Rawalakot.\nBut the renewed tension has the people here worried and not without reason. In January, the crossing was shut for a fortnight after India accused Pakistan of killing two soldiers.\nOn a Monday morning in September, families are gathering at Poonch stadium to take the bus to Rawalakot to meet relatives. Some are here to see off relatives visiting from Pakistan. \nSixty-four-year-old Mohammad Ayub, who left India in 1965 and lives in Rawalpindi, arrived in Poonch on 29 July to visit his sister and her family.  \n\"We are all leaves of the same tree,\" he says, surrounded by sister Aleema Bi, her family and other relatives. \n\"The Poonch-Rawalakot bus has made our lives a lot easier. We are very unhappy over the renewed tension. It will be very sad if the bus service is suspended because of shelling,\" he says.\nStanding near him, Aleema Bi begins to weep. \"He left a long time ago. I\'ve seen him after many years, who knows whether we\'ll be able to meet again,\" she says.\nMohammad Nazir, Mr Ayub\'s nephew, sums up the sentiment well. \"It is usually hard to say goodbye.

The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons. \nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head. \nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election. \nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front. \nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.  \nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead. \nFaizan\'s final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan. \nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday\'s election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region\'s mainstream parties. \nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me. \nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds. \nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday\'s poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government. \nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear. \nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire. \nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir\'s unending tragedy. \nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera. \n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family. \nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa\'s lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn. \n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again. \nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls.

(171, 'Rebuilding lives in Kashmir', '\nMore than 20 years after they took up arms to fight Indian rule in the Kashmir valley, many of the local insurgents are now returning home after renouncing militancy. The BBC\'s Geeta Pandey met some of them.\nAbdul Rashid Khan was 14 when he ran away from home in Indian-administered Kashmir to join the jihad against India. \nHe remembers the year was 1989, but is not too sure about the month - \"it could be September or maybe it was October\".\n\"I was in school, in eighth standard. That day I had an exam to write. I finished the paper, dumped my school bag in a shop and left for Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It was 1:30pm and I was still wearing my school uniform, I took nothing with me,\" he says.\nMr Khan lived in Kulangam town in Kupwara district - not far from the Line of Control which divides the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.\nHe left with a group of eight boys, \"all students like me, some from Sopore, some from Srinagar\". \nScars of separationWho are the militants?\n\"There was a sort of wave then, so I also went,\" he explains.\nBy next evening, the group had reached the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) camp in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\"There I received a month of training in how to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle.\"\nAfter more than 22 years, Abdul Rashid Khan is now back in Kulangam.\nHe was among thousands of Kashmiri youths who, from 1988, crossed over to the Pakistani side to join militant training camps there and fight for freedom from India.\nAccording to Kashmir government estimates, some 3,500 to 4,000 \"boys\" went to Pakistan over nearly two decades.\nBut in the last 12 months, at least 150 of them have come back, Indian officials say, and hundreds others are waiting to return. \nThe trickle which started last year is not yet a flood, but it\'s steadily gaining momentum. \nIndian officials say they have received 1,054 applications from those wanting to return - by early August they had cleared 291 of them and say 300 more are to be cleared soon.\nAnd many of the returnees, including Abdul Rashid Khan, have come back with their families.\nKashmir profile \nQ&A: Kashmir dispute\nReturnees say their reasons for doing so are many - diminishing support from the Pakistani establishment for the Kashmir cause, the growing Talibanisation of Pakistan, a realisation that the Kashmir jihad is \"futile\", homesickness and the Indian government\'s offer of amnesty to those willing to return.\nIn November 2010, the Indian government announced \"a policy to allow for return of ex-militants to Jammu and Kashmir state\". \nUnder the scheme, applicants could fill in a form and, if approved, return via the Wagah border in Punjab, through the Chakan-da-Bagh crossing on the Line of Control or fly into Delhi airport. The scheme was a god-send for Kashmiris looking for a way back home.\nEjaz Ahmad, 52, who went to Pakistan in August 1990, returned home from Muzaffarabad last month with his wife and five children.\n\"About a year and a half ago, I saw a Kashmir assembly debate on the TV news, where I heard them say that those wanting to come back would be allowed to return. \n\"The government said the returnees would be treated with respect, they would be rehabilitated here properly. Both the government and the opposition parties seemed to endorse that view so I decided to come back,\" he says.\nBut his return journey was far from smooth.\n\"To implement this policy which would allow the ex-militants to return, India needed Pakistan\'s co-operation, but Pakistan wouldn\'t agree because they have always said that these people had gone to Pakistan as they were victims of persecution in India,\" a senior Jammu and Kashmir government official told the BBC.\nBut Kashmiris impatient to return home have found a way around this - they are returning via Nepal.\nAnd that\'s the route Abdul Rashid Khan took in May, along with his schoolteacher wife Zeba and their three children.\n\"When I heard that the situation in Kashmir was improving, I told her, let\'s go home.\"\nThe Khans were part of a large group of 40 returnees. \n\"We travelled on Pakistani passports to Nepal. The first day we checked into a hotel in Kathmandu as Pakistani citizens. The next day, we destroyed our passports and drove up to the Indian border near Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh state,\" he says.\nThey were detained by the Indian army, but after cross-checking with police in Kashmir, the group was allowed to travel first to Jammu and then to Srinagar.\nIn Srinagar, they were taken to a \"debrief centre\" where they were interrogated for two days by the police, intelligence agencies and security forces before being handed over to their families in Kashmir.\nEveryone in Indian-administered Kashmir I spoke to agreed that the former fighters could not return in such large numbers without tacit support from Pakistan.\n\"Pakistan must be aware of what\'s going on,\" a senior intelligence official in Srinagar said. \n\"I think it\'s just choosing to look the other way while these people leave. It\'s okay as long as they cross the border illegally, keep it low-profile, because some people, some agencies may not like it,\" he said.\nAbdul Rashid Khan says: \"Pakistan is definitely involved. If the two countries didn\'t have an agreement, there\'s no way I would be allowed to get away.\"\nThe return of the ex-militants is a win-win situation for India.\nFirst, as more and more of them come back, it means the number of potential armed fighters is shrinking and India has fewer of them to worry about.\nSecondly, Delhi can tell the world the situation in Kashmir is normal - so normal that even the former fighters are coming back. \nAnd thirdly, it also gives India an opportunity to discredit the separatist leaders - many of the returnees accuse senior separatists of prospering from the years of militancy while ordinary Kashmiris have been used as \"sacrificial goats\" in the fight for freedom which remains elusive.\nBut, the return of the former fighters is also posing a set of challenges for the Indian authorities.\n\"The ex-fighter is a local Kashmiri and he has parents or family here, he went to school and college here, he has documents to prove his identity,\" a senior bureaucrat says.\n\"But the problem is regarding their Pakistani spouses or children who are foreign citizens who have entered India illegally. Also, because they have destroyed their Pakistani passports, they have no documents to prove their identity.\n\"What do we do with them now? We have taken it up with the government, we have to find a way of legalising them,\" he says.\nThe returnees and their families, meanwhile, are beginning to grow impatient. When I visited Abdul Rashid Khan at his home in Kulangam recently, he was supervising a new home he\'s building for his wife and children.\nZeba, his wife, says moving to Kashmir has been \"the biggest mistake of my life\".\nThe move to a \"remote village\" on the India-Pakistan border has left her frustrated.\n\"I feel Kashmir is stuck in the 1950s,\" she says. \n\"India and Pakistan have moved ahead, but this region is very backward. We have long hours of daily power cuts, there\'s a water shortage and no gas. There are no roads here, no hospitals in the village. At 7pm, all the markets shut and transport stops.\"\nIt\'s not just Kashmir\'s lack of development that Zeba finds difficult to adjust to - what rankles most is the loss of her identity.\n\"We came to Kashmir because my husband said \'my parents and my family are all there, my land and property is there, our children\'s future is not in Pakistan, they have an identity only in Kashmir\'.\n\"I came here searching for their identity, but now I\'ve lost my own. I say I am from Pakistan, but I have no papers to prove it,\" she says.\nHer children - seven-year-old twin daughters and an eight-year-old son - have been admitted into a local school, but those returning with older children say they are being asked for school-leaving certificates. \nMany returnees are also finding it hard to find jobs and have little money as a result.\nEjaz Ahmad exhausted almost all his savings on his return journey - he had to pay close to 300,000 Pakistani rupees ($3,184; £2,039) to arrange travel documents and tickets for his family.\nAnd because they had entered India illegally, they had to seek bail from a court which cost him 210,000 Indian rupees ($3,801; £2,430).\nNow, he wants the government to keep its promise of rehabilitating the returnees which, for him, means travel documents for his family and school admission for his children. \nMr Ahmad says he is in touch with about 20 returnees and they are planning to take up the issue with the state administration. \nThe authorities admit that there is a \"design flaw\" in the amnesty scheme and that there is no agreement yet on how to deal with the returnees\' spouses.\n\"The issue of the wives is a tricky one - she\'s a foreign national. And she\'s stateless at the moment, but we want to assure them that we are thinking about them,\" a government official said.\n\"We are also hoping to put systems in place to ensure they have livelihoods and that they are integrated into the system here.\"\nBut the returnees want action now. \n\"If I don\'t get documents soon. I\'ll try to run away. I don\'t know where I will go, but I\'ve had enough,\" says Zeba Khan.\nAbdul Rashid Khan says he gave up militancy because he does not believe in fighting any more.\nBut, he says, unless the government does something to address their problems soon, he may be forced to do something illegal.\n\"It may be a repeat of the 1990s,\" he warns.\nIs India listening?

But anyone charged under the law cannot apply for bail immediately and so can be instantly imprisoned. \n\"The question of how much criticism a government can tolerate is indicative of the self-confidence of a democracy,\" writes Lawrence Liang in an article for The Wire. \n\"On that count, India presents a mixed picture where, on the one hand, we regularly see the use of sedition laws to curtail political criticism even as we find legal precedents that provide a wide ambit to political expression.\"\nMany of the students believe that the move is a direct assault on their right to dissent.\n\"We are defending the right to have opinions,\" says one student. \n\"You can have opinions on a judgement, you can have opinions on any issue that is going on and they are taking away that right.\"\nSome are angry at suggestions made by BJP leaders, that the university has become a hot-bed of anti-national sentiments with some accusing the campus of supporting Kashmiri militants. \nOne student tells me that they totally condemned the \"anti-national slogans that were [allegedly] raised [at last week\'s rally] by certain fringe elements.\n\"But that doesn\'t give them the right to label an entire university of 10,000 students as anti-national,\" he argued.\nAnd it\'s not just the students who are protesting. Many of the university\'s faculty members have also come out in strong support.\nSurajit Mazumdar, an economics professor, sees the move to arrest Kanhaiya Kumar and charge him with sedition as an attempt to \"terrorise the students into submission\".\n\"JNU has always been a university priding itself on its democratic culture of debate, dialogue and discussion. There are diverse political, ideological and academic opinions that exist in this university and it has always been possible to engage with each other without requiring any police interference,\" he adds.\nBut the issue has divided India sharply with some coming out in support of the government\'s action.\nJust across the university, a counter-protest is taking place with demonstrators holding aloft the Indian flag and carrying placards demanding that JNU be \"cleaned up\" and that \"traitors\" should be hanged.\n\"The university has been built on public land using taxpayers\' money,\" says Sumitra Dahiya.\n\"But they have shamed all of us - by supporting those people who have killed innocent people in India. We want these students to be thrown out of the university.\"\n\"There is no place here for people who support Pakistan and terrorists,\" says Anand Singh, who is also taking part in the protest. \nPrakash Karat, a senior leader of India\'s main Communist party, says the government should immediately withdraw the case of sedition.\n\"It is absurd to charge them with sedition,\" he told the BBC.\n\"At stake is the very democratic ethos in our education system because you have a government that is determined to impose its ideological and communal values into all the educational institutes in this country,\" he added.

(182, 'Viewpoint: Will 2016 be a turning point for free speech in India?', '\nIn December, just before India\'s busy literary festival season swung into full gear, over a hundred journalists across the central state of Chhattisgarh were gathering for another round of protests. \nThey were demonstrating against the arrests earlier in the year of two local journalists, Santosh Yadav and Somaru Nag, in cases they called \"false\". \nThey had been raising their voices ever since August, and with Delhi\'s journalists adding their support, the state government finally agreed to set up an independent committee that might look into cases such as this. \n2015 had been one of the harshest years in memory for India\'s journalists, and for free speech in general - local-language newspapers, reporters and stringers had faced everything from defamation suits to threats and detentions, and worse. \nReporters Without Borders tracked the cases of nine journalists who had been murdered in 2015 - the most dangerous beats were environmental and political corruption. In Nagaland, newspapers blanked out their editorial spaces in November - an unprecedented gesture, as a protest against military directives that threatened to crush free reporting in the media. \nThe rot and the fear were not limited to journalism: 2015 was by any standards one of the worst years for free speech in India, with a sharp rise in defamation cases, sedition cases, majoritarian bullying and everywhere, an undercurrent of violence, a sense that mobs, or hired executioners, were never very far away. \nIn the middle of the year, writers across India had returned their state awards after the Karnataka scholar MM Kalburgi was shot by two unidentified attackers in his own home. \nThis gesture of conscience - spontaneous and unplanned - snowballed into a surprisingly large demonstration of solidarity as hundreds of academics, scientists, film stars and historians joined in the protest against intolerance. \nAt some cost: senior government ministers called the movement a \"conspiracy\", and the rightwing\'s army of trolls attempted to bully the writers, sometimes brazenly spreading lies about them. \nIt is impossible not to believe that 2016 will be a turning point for India and free expression in the subcontinent. \nWe could go under, losing more and more essential freedoms as writers, performers, environmentalists and citizens are caught in the crossfire of pressure from the state, as outspoken voices choke in the pollution caused by bad laws, or succumb to the rule of mobs, thugs and the deliberate violence unleashed by religious and political leaders. \nOr we could see a steady fight wresting back these basic freedoms and demanding them as universal rights, not just rights for the relatively small world of India\'s English-speaking writers and journalists. \nThere is a wider sphere that connects the folk singer Kovan, arrested in November under sedition laws in Tamil Nadu for lampooning the government, with Huchangi Prasad, a young Dalit writer from Karnataka who had been beaten up in October and threatened for his writings on caste and religion, and the well-known writer Arundhati Roy, who faces a contempt of court case this month yet again over her reporting, on flimsy grounds. \n2015 had seen a landslide of alarming and tragic events. But these past years in India had also seen an enormous and unsuspected appetite for books, a nascent fascination with authors, bestselling and otherwise. \nThe single biggest indicator of this was the profusion of literary festivals around the country - over 75 at last count, with the largest of them, the Jaipur Literature Festival, drawing crowds in the hundreds of thousands. \nThey could be spectacles with film stars, cricketing heroes and politicians grabbing the headlines rather than writers, but they were also increasingly one of the few spaces where writers in English and Hindi could meet authors and publishers whose medium was one of India\'s many other languages. \nAt the Hindu Lit For Life in Chennai, I had the chance to hear Kannan Sundaram speak. \nMr Sundaram is the publisher of Perumal Murugan, the writer who erased himself by announcing, \"the death of the writer, Perumal Murugan\". \nHe had been subjected to legal attacks, threatened, and in this deadly game of chess, where writer after writer was accused of provoking acts of organised violence, he had chosen to take himself and his books off the chessboard. Mr Sundaram spoke on the challenges in publishing, a subject on which he was, by any standards, an expert.\nBut on the drive to Jaipur, I was thinking about another incident, an apparently minor one in the present landscape of murders, thuggery, violent intimidation. \nJust before the New Year, novelist and academic Saikat Majumdar had one of his short stories abruptly pulled from the Mint newspaper\'s end-of-the-year fiction special. \nMajumdar got in touch with Delhi\'s nascent PEN chapter to ask if there was anything the group could do to help. The publication was within its rights not to carry his story, but the reason they gave sounded like self-censorship: their lawyers had said the story contained too much \"violence of the words\". \nThe magazine Caravan offered to print the story instead, with an explanatory note, and Majumdar\'s The Father of Man came out in its January issue. \nThe incident left a question mark hanging in the air: were we measuring sentences, now, for the violence of their words, and if so, what was the violence ration? What did editors consider an acceptable, under-the-radar amount of violence for words to bear? \nThe festivals felt, this year, somewhere between an escape from the violence that was bubbling up across the country along fault-lines of gender, caste, race and political allegiance, and something else, something more serious. \nOn the final day at Jaipur, I listened as Nirupama Dutt, the poet and biographer, shared her memories of the murder of Pash, the Punjabi poet, in 1988, another era of turbulent change. \nI felt lucky to be on a session with Ashok Vajpeyi, Uday Prakash and CP Deval, to listen to them talk about what it meant to be a writer in a time of storms, how the writer\'s responsibility was not separate from his or her duty as a citizen. \nIn Jaipur, we spoke about the rise in defamation suits (48 filed in 2015), and what it meant for corporates and state governments to use this law to muzzle critics; about the contempt case against Arundhati Roy; about the rise in sedition cases (14 filed in 2015 against 35 respondents) making it a crime to question your country. \nRoy\'s trials were bookended by the plight of other writers, journalists, environmentalists, that was how greatly the times had changed. \nThere are so many kinds of violence. \nThere is the violence of the word that people fear because it holds up a mirror to what is happening in India today; there is also the violence of not listening to the words of those who have borne the harshest brunt of censorship, of dismissing their struggles and trials without giving them equal weight. \nArundhati Roy is fighting a monstrous and unjust battle, but as people speak up for her, they must not erase the others who fight the same battle, too.

As an ordinary teacher, he will live as P Murugan. Leave him alone.\"\nWith these dramatic words on his Facebook page, the well-known writer in the Tamil language announced his decision to give up writing forever. The provocation: wrathful protests against his novel Madhorubhagan by local Hindu and caste-based groups. \nMurugan also asked his publishers not to print and sell his work and promised to compensate them for the unsold books. He implored his readers to burn his books, and said he would stop attending literary festivals. \nMadhorubhagan, first published in 2010, is set a century ago, It\'s a gripping fictional account of a poor, childless couple, and how the wife, who wants to conceive, takes part in an ancient Hindu chariot festival where, on one night, consensual sex between any man and woman is allowed. Murugan explores the tyranny of caste and pathologies of a community in tearing the couple apart and destroying their marriage. \nThere is \"no historical evidence\", says the writer, that such a mating ritual ever existed and only stories about it were passed on orally. The temple has 11 festivals every year and the chariot festival seems to be still continuing, going by the temple website pictures.  \nMurugan says in the book that during his research he found people who were referred to as \"god-given child\" and \"god\'s child\". He writes: \"I had presumed that they were called so simply because they had been born after prayers to the god. But during my search I chanced upon the connection between the temple festival and god\'s children.\"\nOne critic said the novel \"lays bare with unsparing clarity a relationship caught between the dictates of social conventions and the tug of personal anxieties\". Fellow writers lauded Murugan\'s stark and shocking imagery and his \"sensitive portrait\" of the couple. \"Childless couples, especially the women in these marriages, suffer untold humiliation even today. If anything deserves to be banned, it is this control over women\'s sexuality,\" says Murugan\'s translator Aniruddhan Vasudevan.\nIndia has a long and chequered history of banning books - usually for allegedly offending religious and community sentiments, misrepresenting the country or perceived obscenity -  but such a drastic reaction by a writer who has been clearly intimidated is unprecedented. \nThings reportedly came to a head at a so-called \"peace meeting\" on Monday between Murugan and the groups opposed to him. The author has not spoken about the meeting - the groups had demanded that he offer an unconditional apology, delete the controversial portions, take back unsold copies and stop writing on \"controversial subjects that hurt the sentiments of the people\".\nIt is also not entirely clear why the groups got worked up over a novel published in Tamil four years ago. Murugan reckons the English translation One Part Woman, which was published last year by Penguin, is probably the reason, and that \"somebody who read it could have instigated the local organisations\". He believes caste groups, incensed by some characters in his novel, and pro-Hindu organisations ganged up to force his hand. \nIn December, the right-wing Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, National Volunteers\' Organisation) burnt copies of the book, prompting his publishers and writers to issue a strong statement that cultural vigilantes \"have all too often bullied writers and publishers, attacking our fundamental rights and freedoms of speech and expression\".\nNone of the political parties - regional or national - have spoken in support of Murugan. Many say this conspiracy of silence among India\'s political parties when it comes to freedom of speech bodes ill for the world\'s largest democracy.\nMurugan is one of the finest writers of his generation in the Tamil language. His novels are rooted in the western region of Tamil Nadu where he was born. His stories are peopled by characters caught up in the whirligig of maddening change, struggling peasants, a child bonded to work in an upper caste home to repay the loan taken by his father. He has been outspoken about the evil practice of caste discrimination. A vivid memoir recounts the experience of his farmer father running a soda stall in a cinema to keep the home fires burning. He\'s \"versatile, sensitive to history and conscious of his responsibilities as a writer\", says author and translator N Kalyan Raman in a glowing appraisal of Murugan\'s work.\n\"The silencing of Perumal Murugan,\" says historian Ramachandra Guha, \"is a sad day for Tamil Nadu and for India.\" He and others believe that if Murugan does not return to writing in India\'s disturbing climate of increasing intolerance of freedom of speech, it will be a tragedy. \nOne newspaper sharply reminded that the \"spirit of orthodoxy and heterodoxy have coexisted\" in the Indian intellectual traditions from ancient times. An online petition is already drumming up support for Murugan\'s right to free speech. \"Right now Murugan does not need a pep talk,\" says Vasudevan his translator. \"Perhaps he should be allowed to feel the exhaustion while we speak, write, march and read.
