(1, 'In 11 months, Unnao records 51 rape cases', '\nThe death of a 24-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao on Friday a day after five men, including her two alleged rapists, assaulted and set her on fire has brought a spate of sexual assaults reported in the district over the last 11 months under the spotlight. As many as 51 cases of rape have been registered in Unnao over this period, according to the Uttar Pradesh police data.\nPolice said that 185 cases of stalking and attempt to rape have also been registered between January to November this year in Unnao. “...during the past two years, 24 minors have also been raped in the district...,’’ said Renu Yadav, a police officer posted in the district.\nUnnao police superintendent Vikrant Veer said that they had registered 52 cases of rape this year before one of them was dropped after the charges were found to be bogus.\nUnnao is located 60 km from Lucknow. It hit the headlines after expelled Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Kuldeep Sengar was accused of raping a woman on the pretext of getting her employment when she was a minor in 2017. \nUnnao was again in the news this summer when the woman’s two aunts were killed while she was critically wounded along with her lawyer when a truck rammed the car they were travelling in. \nSachin Dixit, a local activist, said the data can be misleading as many cases are not reported at all. “A case was registered against Sengar only after the woman attempted suicide outside the chief minister’s residence in Lucknow.”', ' Uttar Pradesh Unnao Unnao Uttar Pradesh January November Unnao Renu Yadav Vikrant Veer Unnao Lucknow Kuldeep Sengar Sachin Lucknow', '2019-12-08', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-11-months-unnao-records-51-rape-cases/story-o0dRLqiWKLc5SIlk3grPYM.html'),

The Supreme Court, on November 13, also ordered the setting up FTSCs for quick disposal of over 160,000 Pocso cases.\nOf the 1,023 FTCs,the Centre proposed earmarking 389 to deal exclusively with Pocso cases. The remaining courts were to deal with either rape cases or both rape and Pocso cases, depending on the backlog and requirement. Under the initiative, each FTSC had been expected to dispose of 41-42 cases in each quarter and at least 165 in a year.\nFour months later, only 16 states and UTs have joined the scheme and the Union ministry of law and justice has released the first instalment of funds to set up the courts. \nA senior official from the ministry of law said ~89.1 crore of the ~100 crore of the first instalment of earmarked funds had been allotted already. \nThe states are Jharkhand, Tripura, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Odisha, Manipur, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Delhi. The ministry has now received a request for financial assistance from Chandigarh.\nBoth Telangana and Uttar Pradesh – rape incidents at these two states have sparked public fury – did not take steps to designate special courts. Telangana constituted its first FTC on Wednesday after the rape and murder in Hyderabad. People in the law and justice ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reminders were sent to the states on five occasions – September 5, October 15, October 22, November 5 and November 20.\n“The purpose is to deliver time-bound justice to rape survivors,” said the official cited above. \nThere will be 495 FTSCs in the 16 states and UTs that have concurred with the scheme, of which 206 will be exclusive Pocso courts. As of now, 420 courts have been established and 161 Pocso courts have started functioning.\n“Kerala has sought funds for 28 out of 56 FTSCs in the State. Rajasthan has also requested funds for only 26 as against 45 FTSCs and similarly Odisha has started 24 out of the 45 FTSCs it wants to have,” the official said. Delhi has requested funds for eight FTSCs as against 16 allocated in the scheme.\nSenior Supreme Court advocate VV Giri, who assisted the top court in the case resulting in the November order relating to fast track courts for Pocso cases, said the states had abdicated their duty by not setting up FTSCs in a time-bound manner. \n“There is no need to change the law. One needs a political will to set up FTSCs and not drag the matter. Besides, the state must also appoint a special prosecutor to conduct the trial on behalf of the prosecuting agency. The more the case gets prolonged, chances of tampering by the accused are also high,” Giri added.\nUnder the Centre’s scheme, FTSCs will be set up for one year, spread over two financial years, 2019-20 and 2020-21. A decision on the extension of the scheme beyond one year will depend on the recommendations in an external evaluation to be carried out in the third/fourth quarter of the scheme, and subsequent approvals of the competent authorities.', ' Union Territories Centre Centre Centre Pocso Act ~89.1 Tripura Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Manipur Karnataka Gujarat Haryana Delhi Hyderabad Kerala Rajasthan Odisha Delhi Giri Centre', '2019-12-08', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-states-uts-fail-to-set-up-fast-track-courts-for-speedy-trial-in-rape-cases/story-32QXdKvqjla7Lx6CGAefRP.html'),

Many times unqualified and tainted people took charge as the head of the math so the department has come up with strict rules so that in case of disputes, the government can choose a deserving and appropriate person as per rules,” a senior officer of the department said.\nBJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “It’s a matter of faith and the government shouldn’t interfere in religious institutions.

The BJP at Centre is bent on bringing the legislation based on its numbers in Parliament. We will not accept it and continue protests,” said AASU chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya on Saturday.\nCongress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two main opposition parties in the state, are also protesting against CAB saying it is against provisions of Assam Accord of 1985.\nOn Sunday, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal urged protesters to desist from such activities and focus on development instead. He said his government will not do anything that goes against Assam and Assamese.\n“I appeal to all protesters to give up their agitation as no development can take place through protests. We should focus on peace and create a proper work culture in the state,” Sonowal said while laying foundation stone of a flyover in Guwahati.\nSecurity has been tightened across the state in view of the protests and tabling of CAB in Parliament.

(6, 'Starting point to address slowdown would be to acknowledge it: Raghuram Rajan', '\nFormer Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan said India is in the midst of a “growth recession” with signs of deep malaise in the Indian economy that is being run through extreme centralisation of power in Prime Minister’s Office and powerless ministers.\nPenning down his recommendations to help the ailing Indian economy out of the ongoing slowdown in the India Today magazine, he called for reforms to liberalise capital, land and labour markets, and spur investment as well as growth.\nHe also urged India to join free trade agreements judiciously in order to boost competition and improve domestic efficiency.\n“To understand what has gone wrong, we need to start first with the centralised nature of the current government. Not just decision-making but also ideas and plans emanate from a small set of personalities around the Prime Minister and in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).\n“That works well for the party’s political and social agenda, which is well laid out, and where all these individuals have domain expertise. It works less well for economic reforms, where there is less of a coherent articulated agenda at the top, and less domain knowledge of how the economy works at the national rather than state level,” Rajan wrote.\nStating that previous governments may have been untidy coalitions but they consistently took path of further economic liberalisation, he said, “extreme centralisation, coupled with the absence of empowered ministers and the lack of a coherent guiding vision, ensures that reform efforts pick up steam only when the PMO focuses on them, and lose impetus when its attention switches to other pressing issues”.\n“The Modi government came to power emphasising ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. This slogan is often misunderstood. What was meant was that government would do things more efficiently, not that people and the private sector would be freed to do more. While the government continues the creditable drive to automation -- direct benefit transfer to recipients is an important achievement -- the role of the government in many spheres has expanded, not shrunk,” he said.\nRajan said the starting point to address the economic slowdown will be for the Modi government to acknowledge the problem.\n“The starting point has to be to recognise the magnitude of the problem, to not brand every internal or external critic as politically-motivated, and to stop believing that the problem is temporary and that suppressing bad news and inconvenient surveys will make it go away,” he said. “India is in the midst of a growth recession, with significant distress in rural areas.”India’s economic growth slowed to a 6-year low of 4.5 per cent in the July-September quarter. With inflation rising, fears of stagflation -- a fall in aggregate demand accompanied by rising inflation -- have resurfaced.\nHe said construction, real estate and infrastructure sectors are in “deep trouble” and so are lenders to it like the non-bank finance companies. The crisis among shadow lenders and a build-up of bad loans at banks have curbed lending in the economy.\nSeeking asset quality review of the non-bank finance companies, he said corporate and household debt is rising, and there is deep distress in parts of the financial sector.\nUnemployment, especially amongst youth, seems to be growing, as is the accompanying risk of youth unrest. “Domestic businesses have not been investing either, and the stagnation in investment is the strongest sign that something is deeply wrong,” he said.\nRajan called for reforms in land acquisition, labour laws, stable tax and regulatory regime, fast track bankruptcy resolution of developers in default, proper pricing of electricity, preserving competition in telecom sector and giving farmers access to inputs and finance.\nCalling for not selling already dominant family enterprises to avoid concentration of power, he also wanted decentralisation of power by empowering ministers and engaging states, beginning with amending the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission by not curtailing states’ share of tax revenue.\nRajan said the government should desist from cutting personal income tax rates for the middle-class for now and should use its scarce fiscal resources to support the rural poor through schemes such as the MGNREGA.\nThe repeated government allusions to a USD 5-trillion-economy by 2024, which would necessitate steady real growth of at least 8-9 per cent per year starting now, seem increasingly unrealistic, he added.\n“Furthermore, even if some of the problems are legacies, the government, after five-and-a-half years in power, needs to resolve them. A massive new reform thrust is needed, accompanied by a change in how the administration governs,” he said.\nRajan said the Modi government has shown “surprising timidity” when it comes to unfinished reforms on the business environment, land acquisition, labour and the role of the public sector.

He also expressed concern over “loss of trust” in the criminal justice system.\n“People across the country are agitated over reports of horrible rape and murder incidents happening across the country. People are in anger over rape cases that have come to light of late - whether it is Unnao or Hyderabad. That’s a reason why people are expressing happiness and satisfaction over the police encounter in Hyderabad,” said Kejriwal on the sidelines of an event.\nHe further said, “It is also something to be worried about, the way people have lost their faith in the criminal justice system. This demands introspection and all governments must come forward and work together towards strengthening the criminal justice system and investigating agencies.”\nAll the four accused in the rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Telangana last week were killed in an encounter in the early hours of Friday, police said.\nKejriwal further urged President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy petition of one of the convicts in December 2012 gangrape incident in Delhi. The petition has been filed by Vinay Sharma.\n“It is now with the President and we request him to reject the mercy petition too so that all the convicts are hanged at the earliest.” \nOn October 27, the prison management in New Delhi had written to Sharma and three other convicts – Pawan Gupta, Akshay Thakur, and Mukesh Singh - reminding them that the four were on death row. The jail officers told them that they had exhausted their legal options and that the prison department would start the process for their hanging if the four did not file a mercy plea. Of the four convicts, Sharma is the only one to file a mercy plea.\nThe Delhi government had last week recommended the rejection of his petition.', ' Delhi Arvind Kejriwal Telangana Unnao Hyderabad Hyderabad Kejriwal Kejriwal Ram Nath Kovind Delhi Vinay Sharma Pawan Gupta Akshay Thakur Mukesh Singh Sharma', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happiness-over-hyderabad-encounter-shows-people-have-lost-faith-in-justice-system-kejriwal/story-kqx9zCeEGRnCDBDxRgfeFP.html'),

Her body was brought to the village from Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Saturday. \nHer sister said the last rites would be performed only in the presence of Adityanath.\n“I want to speak to Yogi Adityanath personally,” she said.\nShe also claimed her sister was about to get a government job and that she was about to join it.

(11, 'UK general election likely to throw up good result for Indian-origin candidates', '\nWith just days to go before the UK General Election on Thursday, the new Parliament set to be voted in is expected to be the most diverse in Britain’s history based on projections and what experts believe has been a late surge in diversity from the country’s main political parties.\n The last election in 2017 had thrown up 12 Indian-origin MPs, including the first female Sikh MP Preet Kaur Gill and the first turbaned Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi – both for the Opposition Labour Party.\n Next week’s election looks set for a hike on that number, with Labour’s Navendru Mishra and Conservatives’ Gagan Mohindra and Goan-origin Claire Coutinho among the frontrunners to clinch their party’s strongholds.\n “The next Parliament looks set to be our most-diverse ever – with more ethnic minority candidates likely to be elected whichever way the political pendulum swings on election night,” says an analysis by the British Future think tank.\n “Candidate selections have been very much a game of two halves – with a late surge in selections to replace retiring MPs and those who were standing down mitigating a decline in the proportion of non-white candidates selected in target seats,” it notes.\n The ethnic minority surge in the number of MPs is expected to include all the Indian-origin MPs from the last election, except Labour’s Keith Vaz – who announced his resignation just ahead of the election in the wake of a sex scandal.\n For the Tories, Priti Patel, Alok Sharma, Rishi Sunak, Shailesh Vara and Suella Braverman are set for a return.

As all the farmers will get assistance under PM-Kisan from 2019-20, no assistance for Rabi crops will be given to farmers under Kalia scheme. Keeping parity of both the schemes, the small farmers/ marginal farmers will be given Rs 5,000 for 2019-20 and Rs 4,000 per year from 2020-21 under Kalia, so that they will get Rs 10,000 annually i.e. Rs 6,000 from PM-Kisan and Rs 4000 under Kalia. The large farmers who did not get any assistance under Kalia will get Rs 6000 annual assistance under the PM-Kisan scheme,” said the notification which was published in the Gazette on Saturday.\nThe notification said 14.7 lakh landless farmers of the State will, however, continue to get Rs 12,000 per year under the Kalia scheme as there was no provision for landless farmers under the central scheme.\nThe Kalia scheme for small and marginal farmers as well as sharecroppers was announced in December 2018 by Naveen Patnaik government to help ride out the farm distress and helped the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) retain power for the fourth  consecutive term. \nIn the first installment, the state government spent Rs 2552 crore on more than 51 lakh small and marginal and landless farmers giving them Rs 5000 each as farm assistance for purchase of inputs like seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and labour charges per agriculture season.\nWith a projected expenditure of Rs 8122.60 crore in 2019-20 and 2020-21 for the Kalia scheme, the State government had already halved the beneficiary list for Kalia in second installment by pruning it to 25.9 lakh farmers. \nIn February, the Centre had started Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme with income support of Rs 6000 per year to all farmer families across the country in three equal installments of Rs 2000. \nIn the run-up to the election to the State Assembly and Lok Sabha this year, opposition BJP had accused the Naveen Patnaik government of not sending the list of intended beneficiaries of PM-Kisan scheme to the Union agriculture ministry alleging that it was scared of PM Narendra Modi’s popularity in Odisha. Even Modi in his election speeches in Odisha had accused the state government of not providing the Centre with the list of eligible farmers for PM-Kisan scheme.\nBJP spokesperson Golak Mohapatra said the government’s announcement of Kalia scheme before polls showed that it was a pre-election gimmick. “During election the State government launched ‘Kalia’ to get votes. It knew that that it won’t be able to run the scheme for long as it has little money. To disburse the first installments, the government used up its contingency fund. Now that it is running out of money, it smartly decided to converge it with the central scheme,” said Mohapatra.\nState Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik said Odisha govt announced Kalia and Biju Swasthya Kalyan scheme ahead of 2019 polls. “But now that they don’t have the required money to continue the scheme, they want the Modi govt to bail them out.

Environmental activists and researchers warned that a transfer of clearances would pose the risk of past violations of by mining companies.\n“Prior to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act 2015, there was a provision for extension of lease after its expiry. But now that has changed. On March 31, 2020 the lease of over 40 mines will expire. The forest clearance is co-terminus with the lease,” said Siddhanta Das, director general of forests and special secretary in the environment ministry.\n“The new leases will be allotted through auction. We propose to extend the forest clearances for these mines to work within the same broken area and capacity. This can avoid any major disruption in production,” Das said.\nThe issue was discussed at a Forest Advisory Committee meeting on October 17, where it was recommended that the ministry seek legal advice from the law ministry before placing facts before the committee because it involves interpretation of laws.\nThe Federation of Indian Mineral Industries has appealed to the environment ministry for the extension in forest and environmental clearances. It has also sought an extension of the lease period until 2030 for the 48 mines facing expiry by March 31, 2020.\nAn analysis of the FIMI has shown that 265,000 people will be left jobless because of the expiry of the leases, a spokesperson for the federation said. \n“It will impact production. More than 30% of India’s iron ore production will be wiped out for some time.”\nIdeally, the lease period should be extended for 20 years at a time until reserves last, the spokesperson said. “We are, however, not sure how the environment ministry can extend clearances when the lease itself expires,” he added.\nAccording to FIMI, the lease of 48 operational mines will expire in March next year. \n“The legal clarity needed here is not just about the power to extend or transfer forest clearances. It is about the huge liabilities that have built up over decades. The Supreme Court’s MB Shah Commission had pointed out that many iron ore mines had violated forest clearance procedures.” \n“This means that the impacts on ecology and livelihoods are a result of that illegality. In most cases the remediation is still pending even if fines may have been paid,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank.\nThe Shah Commission in 2014 found large-scale violation of environment and forest laws in Odisha because of illegal mining practices by lease holders.\n“The Shah Commission found gross violations in the mining sector in Odisha.

(30, 'In Haryana’s Jind, little changed after a khap order to drop caste surnames', '\nOn June 29, the elders of Khera Khap, a community of 24 villages and over 200,000 people in Haryana’s Jind district, passed a diktat urging its residents to stop using surnames indicative of their caste. Instead, villagers in the Jat-dominated Khap were told to adopt the name of their village as their surname.\nThe decision was made at a mahapanchayat, a traditional gathering of the Khap’s elders, attended by representatives of all 24 villages in its jurisdiction.\n“Casteism is more dangerous than the problem of terrorism and Naxalism in India, where more than 70% of Indians live in the villages, where caste determines everything,” said Satbir Singh Barsola, the pradhan of the khap, who spearheaded the initiative,explaining the reason for the diktat.\n“People from the lower castes feel dominated in villages and the move to drop caste identity from names has been widely welcomed by them,” added Barsola, who retired from the Indian Army as a company havildar major. “We have formed committees in all the 24 villages with members from all communities to spread the word on the move and other initiatives”.\nBarsola, a Jat,himself is practising what he preached. He has adopted the name of his village, Barsola, as his surname.\nYet, however well-intentioned it may have been, it is arguable how much of a success the initiative has been in a part of northern India where caste is a deep-rooted way of life and differences based on caste, often bitter, are never too far from the surface.\nMost people in Khera Khap are dependent on agriculture, and grow cotton, rice, wheat and bajra. \nIn their Jat-dominated villages, where Brahmins are the second largest community, the upper castes are mostly farmers, and the Dalits are mostly farm and construction labourers who have to work hard to make ends meet. \n“Not many from the region have government jobs. Some of our educated men have been able to join the army as jawans or have opened small businesses other than being farmers,” khap pardhan Barsola says.\nTake, for instance, 21-year-old Sandeep Khatkar, who is a reluctant farmer and is resentful of the government job and college seat quotas set apart for scheduled castes, tribes and other backward classes in a form of affirmative to uplift the traditionally underprivileged communities.\n“Please buy this land if you want to, I am done with it,” Khatkar joked, referring to the cotton farm where he is overseeing workers he has hired to harvest the crop.\n“I liked studying and scored 82% in my class 12 exams in the non-medical stream. But I failed to get admission in the government college in Jind because the last cut-off for my stream was 84%. However, the students from the Scheduled Castes category secured seats with less marks than me because the cut-off for them was only 75%. Had it not been for the reservation policy, I would have gone to college and become something,” says the cotton grower, a resident of Barsola village in Jind district, who belongs to the Jat community and is a Khatkar by gotra.\n“Because of reservations, the quality of life for the upper castes has regressed while the lower castes have progressed and risen above us,” he said as a dozen women pick the cotton from the bolls. All the women labourers belong to the Dalit community. Khatkar like most land-owning farmers, pays Rs10 to every worker for every kilo of cotton they pick.\nSuch resentment sparked a Jat agitation in 2016 in Haryana for inclusion of their caste, otherwise thought to be among the more prosperous communities in northern India, in the OBC list to make them eligible for reservations.\nKhatkar hasn’t followed the diktat of the village elders to drop his surname.\n“Dalits and those who belong to the upper castes are not created equal and we are not the same kind of people. But there is a feeling of brotherhood among all the people in the village. There is no need for anyone to drop or change their surnames,” said Khatkar.\nAnd 45-year-old Azad Singh Munda from Khatkar village(adjacent to Barsola) couldn’t care less about the khap’s diktat, either. He hasn’t dropped his surname.\n“I have never heard of this decision and I have not seen people around me drop their caste name,” said the farm worker, who is a Dalit and belongs to the Valmiki caste.\nMunda claims to have bigger things to worry about. “I have an LPG {liquified petroleum gas} connection but I can’t afford the gas cylinder. I own less than three bighas and I cannot depend on farming alone to run my house.”\nWith the cotton having been harvested in many of the farms in the region, Munda collects from then flowerless shrubs that he can use as firewood.\n“Only the Jats give importance to their caste names, the Valmikis and other Dalits are more bothered about money and land because they don’t have any,” says the numberdar of Mohangarh Chapra village, Ram Mehar. Some 15 km away from Barsola, Mohangarh Chapra is one of the 24 villages under Khera khap.\nA numberdar collects revenue on land on behalf of the district tehsildar and is paid an honorarium.\n“In this village, there are more than 500 persons and their families are mostly landed. However, Dalits have no or very little land. The eight families that belong to the Chamar caste own a total of 32 killas whereas the Valmiki families, which are almost 100 in number, own almost no land,” said Mehar, a Dalit.\nTo be sure, Mehar acknowledges that some things have changed.\n“The villages have moved ahead from the time when Dalits would not be allowed to drink water in the same utensils as the upper castes or not given a khaat to sit on when they would enter other people’s homes. There is social equality to some extent now, but economic equality among all castes is nowhere to be seen,” Mehar summarises his final words.\nKhap leaders say that dropping caste surnames can help in dismantling social barriers, but caste identities . are too firmly entrenched in these parts.\n“The move is fine but different castes should not mingle with each other. Jats cannot marry Dalits and if such a thing happens, the couple would be ostracized from the village,” said 65-year-old Ram Kala Khatkar, a Jat from Barsola.\nThe young and women of the upper castes swear by his views.\n“The khap leader, Satbir, is free to do whatever he likes to do to his name but everyone is free to think and act according to their wishes. I will not drop my gotra from my name and neither will I ever marry a Dalit,” said 20-year-old Amit Bhabber, who took up farming after completing school.\n“Honestly, very few women in my village have heard about the khap’s move of dropping caste surnames. This is the first time I am hearing about it,” 34-year-old Navita, who is an Anganwadi worker in Mohangarh Chapra, told this reporter. “The village does not give consent for inter-caste marriages. People can change their names if they want to but if there is a move that aims to annihilate caste completely, it would be resisted tooth and nail”.\n“Why should we change our caste surnames? Our caste is our pride,” said 22-year-old Amit Khatkar, posing with his motorcycle with Khatkar written on it.\n“This is my gotra and my identity. When the pradhan can write his designation on his motorcycle then why can’t I? It is a matter of how everyone identifies themselves?”he said.\nHe stopped 19-year-old Suraj Bhabher, who is riding a motorcycle too. “Look, caste is important to everyone in the village,” he said, pointing to the Royal Jat sticker pasted on the two-wheeler’s bonnet.\nThe few who support the khap’s decision to drop surnames indicative of their castes do so to bridge the divide among upper caste communities that surfaced in the aftermath of the 2016 agitation for backward class reservations for Jats.\n“There were many communities that did not support our demand for reservations and when we didn’t get what we wanted, a lot of people really started to assert their Jat identity in public spaces. This included making declarations about being Jat on their vehicles or on social media platforms like Facebook. The khap’s diktat sought to do away with such displays that could create further rifts among different communities,” said Balbir Singh of Mohangarh Chaapra, who runs a small electronics shop in the village.\nBack in his house, Satbir Singh Barsola shows off the numerous cutouts of newspaper reports lauding the khap’s decision, surrounded by other khap elders. A restless Dalbir Singh is waiting to jump into the discussion. \n“ The media is solely making it out to be a move against caste identity but we are more concerned about the new divisions among the Jats and non-Jats,” said the 40-year-old farmer. “There have been cases when some of the Jats would not even help victims from other communities, like the Sainis, in a road accident as soon as they found out about their identities”.\nIf people use the name of their village instead of their caste in their surnames, such differences can be bridged, he said.\nAs other khap members, mostly Jats, endorse his view they, like most upper-caste villagers, also support the abolition of caste-based reservations.\n“We want all the villagers to live in unity. It is the politicians and policies like reservation that foster caste divides, “ said Udayveer Singh, a spokesperson for the khap. “Caste-based reservations should be done away with completely and reservations should only be based on economic status.”\n“ Caste-based reservations did not help the oppressed castes, they were only used as vote bank by political leaders. Representations through caste-based reservations only further perpetuate caste stigmas,” said khap pradhan Satbir Singh Barsola.\nThe khap has formed committees in all the 24 villages under it to discouraging caste surnames.\n“Dropping caste surnames seems like a good idea but if the khap leaders, who are all Jats, want to stop caste-based reservations then why are the Jats asking for reservations themselves,” asked 42-year-old Ajeet Singh, who works as a daily-wage labourer in the village.\n“While all upper-caste are landed, like most Valmikies family in the village, I am landless. With the jobs that I do, I earn less than Rs 10,000 a month. My son is pursuing BTech and my daughter is a BA student and this education would have not been possible without reservations,” he added.\nWriters on caste-related issues don’t necessarily share the view that dropping surnames would help dismantle caste barriers .\n“ How does dropping a caste surname actually make a difference? In the villages, everyone knows each other’s caste anyway. A lot of people, especially in South India, use their village’s name. Dr BR Ambedkar used his village’s name as a surname but everyone knew he was a Dalit. Dropping surnames doesn’t change how people would be treated, especially in villages,” said Kancha Illiah Shepherd, theorist, writer, and Dalit rights activist.\n“Abolition of casteism would mean reforms and practices like inter-dining and inter-caste marriages but we also have to recognize everyone in the khap is operating in a backward setup. Jats have been landed but since they have always been an agrarian community, they are not very well educated and don’t have an intellectual class among themselves,” he said. “For something like inter-caste marriage to become a norm there, there have to be reforms that make modern education accessible to all of them.”', ' Khera Khap Haryana Jind Khap Khap Naxalism India Satbir Singh Barsola Barsola Jat Barsola Khera Khap Brahmins Dalits Barsola Sandeep Khatkar Khatkar Jind Castes Barsola Jind Jat Khatkar Dalit Jat Khatkar Azad Singh Munda Khatkar Dalit Valmiki Valmikis Dalits Mohangarh Chapra Ram Mehar Barsola Mohangarh Khera Dalits Chamar Mehar Dalit Mehar Dalits Dalits Kala Khatkar Jat Barsola Dalit Amit Bhabber Honestly Mohangarh Chapra Amit Khatkar Khatkar Royal Jat Jats Balbir Singh Mohangarh Chaapra Satbir Singh Barsola Dalbir Singh Jats Sainis Jats Udayveer Singh Satbir Singh Barsola Ajeet Singh Valmikies Dalit Kancha Illiah Shepherd Dalit', '2019-12-08', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-haryana-s-jind-little-changed-after-a-khap-order-to-drop-caste-surnames/story-NUJWHFziUjJLuXWC9APAgJ.html'),

Our studies have shown eating all calories within a consistent 10-hour window, and fasting for the remaining hours in a day, protects from diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases etc,” said Dr Satchin Panda,  professor, Salk Institute, and author of  The Circadian Code. \nHowever, water is allowed during the fasting period. “One can have water and medicines when fasting. For those addicted to tea or coffee, one cup without milk or sugar can be had,” added Panda.\nThe science behind it is based on the concept of the circadian rhythm, which is the 24-hour cycle of living beings.\n“Like the brain, every organ of our body has its own clock that needs its own downtime. The downtime for an organ comes when we fast. Our lab studies in mice cured hundreds of them of diabetes by merely following the 10-hour eating window pattern,” said Panda.\nThe study was extended to humans with similar results, he added. “We asked them to follow the time schedule that was self-selected for 12 weeks, and they had improved parameters at the end of the study that confirmed the findings,” he said.\nThe second expert on the panel, Dr David Ludwig, professor, paediatrics and nutrition, Harvard University & paediatric endocrinology, Boston Children’s Hospital, stressed on the importance of food and diets. \n“In India, for example, Type 2 diabetes is big; and to stop this epidemic diet, plays a great role, especially avoiding processed carbohydrates that result in most of the metabolic disorders that give rise to diabetes, hypertension etc. We need to rediscover the ancient wisdom that says let food be your medicine,” he said.\n“Also, if you cut down on processed carbohydrates it will put less stress on your body when you are going from eating to fasting. Shift the focus on quality of food from quantity. Increasing protein intake is healthier than consuming processed carbohydrates,” he said. \nRestricting eating time automatically will reduce the total number of calories consumed in a day. \nLudwig also addressed an oft-asked question on whether wheat was good for health. “There  are a couple of problems with wheat. We’re not eating it the way we used to centuries ago. Wheat products now are highly processed... like white bread,” he said. Consuming these products results in a spike in blood sugar levels, as compared to eating say, a quantity of beans with the same number of calories. \n“Then there’s a specialised issue which relates to gluten, which is a type of protein... that make wheat sticky... Some people are extremely sensitive to wheat. When they eat gluten, their gastro-intestinal tracts get inflamed, and that’s called Celiac disease... But there’s probably some additional people, who don’t have Celiac, but when they eat wheat, there is low-grade inflammation.” This might affect hunger or general well being, Ludwig said and suggested that in such cases, people should give up wheat. “There is no human requirement for wheat,” he said.

(34, 'Unmarried couple staying in a hotel neither illegal nor criminal: Madras HC', '\nAn unmarried couple staying together in a hotel room is neither illegal nor a criminal offence, the Madras High Court has said and made it clear that a live-in relationship between two adults cannot be deemed to be an offence.\nJustice MS Ramesh, on Friday, also directed the authorities in Coimbatore city to de-seal a service apartment complex which had been sealed after an unmarried couple was found staying together.\nThe court wondered at the action of the authorities sealing the complex based on the mere fact of two adults occupying a room and spotting a few liquor bottles, without any notice or a written order.\nThe Judge said the extreme step of sealing the service apartment of a popular chain of budget hotels appeared to have been taken following news circulated on social media that the apartment complex was being used for short stays and holding it to be immoral.\n“When a live-in relationship between two adults is not deemed to be an offence, the occupation of a hotel room by an unmarried couple will not attract any criminal offence. While that being so, the extreme step of sealing the premises on the ground that an unmarried couple was occupying it is totally illegal,” the Judge ruled.\n“When a specific question was put to the respondents (police and revenue officials) as to what could be the illegality in permitting unmarried couples to stay in hotel rooms, they had no answer. Apparently,” the Judge pointed out and said that there are no laws or regulations preventing unmarried people of opposite sexes to stay in hotels.\nOn the question of recovery of liquor bottles from one of the rooms, the Judge said it was not the case of the officials that the management was supplying liquor to the guests without a licence.\nThe Judge also drew attention to the fact that the Tamil Nadu Liquor (Possession for Personal Consumption) Rules of 1996 allowed an individual to keep 4.5 litres of Indian Made Foreign Liquor and 4.5 litres of foreign liquor, 7.8 litres of beer and 9 litres of wine at any given point of time.\n“As such, consumption of liquor by the guests on the petitioner’s premises cannot also be termed illegal. Above all, the entire episode of sealing the premises is in total violation of principles of natural justice,” Justice Ramesh noted, adding that the officials should have sought an explanation from the management before taking any coercive step when the alleged ‘immoral’ activities at the apartment do not constitute any offence.\nThe Judge directed the Coimbatore District Collector to de-seal the premises within two days of receiving the court order.', ' Madras High Court Judge Tamil Nadu Liquor Made Foreign Ramesh Coimbatore District Collector', '2019-12-07', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unmarried-couple-staying-in-a-hotel-neither-illegal-nor-criminal-madras-hc/story-cQUMBB51omc7lNmiarcYYM.html'),

She suffered 95% burns and was briefly treated at two state government hospitals before being airlifted to New Delhi late Thursday night.\nThe victim, who was on ventilator support, suffered cardiac arrest at 10 minutes past 11 pm on Friday night and was declared dead 30 minutes later at 11:40 pm, said hospital sources.\n“Doctors tried to resuscitate her for almost 30 minutes but to no avail.

As a responsible person, I will ask for a thorough inquiry.”\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and minister of state for agriculture and farmers welfare, Parshottam Rupala, said due process needs to be followed in justice delivery.  “Justice has to be delivered by the judiciary, there should be a process followed… This [the encounter] has happened while the security forces were carrying out their duty, there could have been an error…,” he said in Rajya Sabha.\nCyberabad Police commissioner VC Sajjannar maintained that the accused were killed in crossfire when they snatched police weapons and tried to escape from one of the scenes of the crime. While the police action was celebrated across different quarters, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that justice cannot be retributive in nature. “How we must secure the lives and dignity of each of our citizens, must be what civilised societies are about. Justice can never be retribution. Why is the tough law put in place on the safety of women after the 2012 Delhi crime not being implemented properly?” he asked.\nThe incident comes in the wake of protests across the country over crimes against women, with many demanding stringent laws and a more effective judicial process to ensure safety for women. Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, backed the police action, stating: “I am happy that at least someone got justice. But real happiness would dawn when a safe and secure environment is ushered in wherein such gruesome crimes do not happen with any woman.” \nEchoing a similar view, BJP parliamentarian Meenakshi Lekhi, said women across the country would be feeling relieved after the death of the four men. “All women in the country must be feeling relieved somewhere now, not happy because no death can give happiness but some amount of satisfaction. They [the accused] had done wrong deeds and on top of that they were trying to flee from the police custody, so there was no option left for the police.”\nSenior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said at times, the mood of the country takes “precedence over human rights logic”. “Sometimes in spite of all the debates and human rights logic, we shall understand the mood and sentiments of the people of the nation and stand with them. After all, democracy is all about the people,” he tweeted.\nTelangana’s ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi maintained that the state government was not linked to Friday’s incident. “We had appointed a fast-track court for the trial in the case.

(64, 'HTLS 2019| Will have to shut telco if no govt relief, says Birla', '\nAditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla sounded a stark warning on Friday, saying the group’s telecom unit, Vodafone Idea Limited, would have to shut shop if no relief is forthcoming from the government to soften the blow from a Supreme Court verdict that it pay the department of telecommunications ~40,000 crore in three months.\nBirla,who is also chairman of Vodafone Idea, said he is hopeful the company doesn’t find itself in a situation where it needs to exit from the market.\n“But, at the same time, if you ask me specifically, it is true we will shut shop if we don’t get relief. Because there is no company in the world that can pay that kind of fine in three months, it just doesn’t work like that,” Birla added in a conversation at the Hindustan Times leadership summit.\nHis remarks caused Vodafone Idea stock to fall sharply on the BSE and end 5.34% lower to ~6.92 on a day the benchmark Sensex fell 0.82% to 40,445.15 points at the close of trading.\nOn October 24, the Supreme Court allowed the central government to recover Rs 92,641 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) from telecom companies in a verdict that hit Bharti Airtel Limited and Vodafone Idea the hardest. The court accepted the government’s definition of AGR — that it includes their income from revenue lines that are not central to their main business.\nIncome from sales of handsets, termination and roaming charges, rent and dividends should count as part of AGR, which determines what telecom companies pay as licence fee and spectrum usage fee, the court ruled in a verdict that came at a time when debt-laden service providers are already under intense pressure because of adverse regulatory orders,hefty levies and intense competition amid a price war set off by the entry in 2016 of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel both posted record losses in the September quarter,\nThe court order came in a 16-year-old case stemming from DoT claims that telecom companies had under-reported their revenue and thus paid less for spectrum and in the form of other levies.\n“So the big elephant in the room is AGR, which is something that lies in the courts [with the judiciary]. I believe the government can have a dialogue — this was a suit filed by the government against the TSPs (telecom services providers). Since the government has won, it gives them headroom to talk to the judiciary and find some sort of a solution. And I hope that happens,” BIrla said.\nBirla said the government had come to realise that “this is a very critical sector, the whole digital India programme rests on this, and it is a strategic sector.”\n“They have publicly stated that they want three players from the private sector and one player from the public sector, so I think we can expect much more stimulus from the government because it is required by the sector to survive. If we weren’t getting anything, then I think that is the end of the story for Vodafone Idea.”\nAt a London roundtable in November, Vodafone Plc’s chief executive officer Nick Read had said that the situation in India’s telecom sector was critical. “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario — can’t get any clearer than that,” Read said in remarks reported by Bloomberg from which he distanced himself a day later.\n“I think since Nick made that statement the government seems to have done a lot,” Birla said.\n“The realisation is now that you need more players in the sector, because it is strategic and it is not in national interest having so many TSPs [telecom service providers] shutting down,” he said.\nIn November,the government offered ~42,000 crore in relief to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio by unveiling a two-year moratorium on yearly instalments they have to pay for spectrum they bought at auction.\nVodafone Idea has a cash balance that’s half of the Rs 40,000 it owes the government, and Birla stressed that without government intervention, the company could choose not to infuse more money in to the business.\n“It does not make sense to put good money after bad,” he said.\nBirla also pitched for more stimulus measures from the government, which has already offered a corporate tax cut that entails a revenue sacrifice of Rs 1.45 lakh crore a year,easier access to credit for non-banking financial companies, a real estate fund to revive stalled housing projects and a more transparent and efficient income tax regime.He also called for lower Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates.\n“The government has taken many steps but we need a stronger fiscal stimulus. If GST is brought down to 15%, that would be a huge stimulus,” Birla said.\nThe Indian economy, Asia’s third-largest, is in the midst of a slowdown that has caused the growth rate to decline for six consecutive quarters,most recently to 4.5% in the quarter ended September, the lowest pace of growth since March 2013. On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India cut its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 5% from 6.1%.\n“It could take the Indian economy 18-20 months before it improves,” Birla said.\nHe also described the global economic mood as sombre.\n“It is more than a trade war. No parallel to the US-China trade war in history. It is a war for global economic supremacy. History has no parallel to indicate how it will play out,” Birla said.', ' Aditya Birla Group Kumar Mangalam Birla Vodafone Idea Limited Vodafone Idea Birla Hindustan Times Vodafone Idea Sensex Bharti Airtel Limited Vodafone Idea Mukesh Ambani Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited Vodafone Idea Bharti Airtel Birla Vodafone Vodafone Plc Nick Read Read Bloomberg Nick Birla Bharti Airtel Vodafone Idea Reliance Jio Vodafone Birla Birla Birla Reserve Bank India Birla Birla', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2019-will-have-to-shut-telco-if-no-govt-relief-says-birla/story-DOlF1GJDjtA3aStwtT6oaI.html'),

We have asked our missions and posts to sensitize the local government that in case he happens to transit or be in that country, they should let us know,” Kumar told a weekly news briefing.\nBesides alerting other countries, the external affairs ministry cancelled Nithyananda’s passport “much before” its expiry in September 2018, he said.\n“When we got information about the cases which were pending against him, what we did was we cancelled his passport first. He applied for a fresh passport, which was denied and put on hold because he couldn’t get the requisite clearance from the police. It was an adverse report from the police,” he added.\nReferring to reports about Nithyananda creating his own country, Kumar said: “On an individual declaring a state or a nation, do you really expect me to answer that question? Setting up a website is very different from creating a nation. So what essentially has been done (is that) he has opened a website and he’s saying that this is my nation. So I don’t think I should really answer that question.”\nIt couldn’t immediately be ascertained how Nithyananda left India after his passport was cancelled last year. He is believed to have travelled to South America from Nepal, and Gujarat Police said about two weeks ago that he had fled the country as authorities were gathering evidence against him after two of his disciples were remanded to custody.\nAn FIR was filed against Nithyananda on charges of kidnapping and confining children to make them collect donations from followers to run his ashram. Officials said a rape case was also registered against him in Karnataka.\nKumar declined to speculate on Nithyananda’s current whereabouts and said extradition proceedings could start only after a formal request is received from security agencies.\nThe embassy of Ecuador said in a statement the country had “denied the request for international personal protection (refuge) made by Mr. Nithyananda before Ecuador and later on, Mr Nithyananda left Ecuador presumably on his way to Haiti”.\nIt added that all reports in the Indian media about him creating his own country were based on information allegedly sourced from the website kailaasa.org, “which is supposedly maintained by Mr Nithyananda or by his people”.', ' Ecuador Raveesh Kumar Ecuador New Delhi Nithyananda Kumar Nithyananda Kumar Nithyananda Gujarat Karnataka Kumar Ecuador Mr. Nithyananda Ecuador Ecuador Haiti', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nithyananda-wanted-for-crimes-india-alerts-other-countries/story-bEs63cdIpcj37yGo7nJBtK.html'),

It had further said that election dates for urban local bodies would be revealed later.\nA bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bopde ordered the SEC to conduct the civic polls in the districts except for the newly bifurcated districts including Villupuram, Kallakkurichi, Ranipet, Thiruppattur, Vellore, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi for complying with legal formalities such as a fresh delimitation exercise and for deciding the issue of reservation for women and SC/ST candidates.\nKallakkurichi was earlier with Villupuram district.

It’s been done at the ACB level. I had resigned a day earlier,” said Fadnavis, implying that the clean chit was not done on his watch.\nThe former chief minister, who initiated the open inquiry against Pawar in the irrigation scam in December 2014 soon after he took over the top job in the state, also said that he would oppose this clean chit.\n“This (the ACB affidavit) is very surprising. How can one affidavit already filed by ACB be contradicted by another affidavit? I totally oppose this and I am sure that the court will not accept this,” Fadnavis told HT.\nIn the tug of war last month between Shiv Sena and the BJP over government formation in Maharashtra, Fadnavis, in a surprising move, took oath as chief minister along with Pawar as his deputy.\nPawar had then supported Fadnavis as a group leader of his party’s 54 MLAs, against his uncle and NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s wishes.\nThe affidavit filed on November 27 says: “Considering facts and evidence collected during the course of inquiry/investigation, it is observed that there is no criminal liability on the part of chairman of Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC).”\nThe clean chit refers to two main allegations against Pawar as the former water resources minister and ex-officio chairman of VIDC from 1999 to 2009 - handing out arbitrary cost escalations to irrigation projects and giving contractors mobilisation advance in contravention to norms.\nIt is, as Fadnavis mentions, an about turn from the affidavit filed by the ACB in November 2018, when the agency indicated that Pawar was culpable in a “modus operandi” to “defraud the government” but sought more time to reach a logical conclusion.\nThe affidavit has exonerated Pawar on the issue of cost escalations by pointing out that majority of the tender hikes were in the range of five per cent and were cleared by the executive director of VIDC, or in some cases, the secretary.\nIt says the minister just signed the note sheets, which had no negative remarks on them.\n“There is no evidence to show that the secretary had briefed the minister about not accepting liability of the cost escalations.”\nWith regards to the mobilisation advance, the affidavit says that the government through two letters dated September 10, 2018 and 11 June, 2019, clarified that there is no loss to the government due to the handing out of mobilisation advance.\nThe earlier affidavit by former ACB chief and incumbent Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve, however, had pointed out that there was a set modus operandi in the way the irrigation project costs were hiked and mobilisation advances were doled out to favour a certain cartel of contractors.\n“The entire affidavit is shameless cover up. It has sought to dispose of the petition and give a clean chit to the main accused even while investigations in as many as 202 tenders and completion of 20 FIRs is underway. Every irrigation cost hike has been cleared by Pawar himself by contravening existing norms,” said Anjali Damania, activist who played a key role in exposing the irrigation scam.\nThe main petitioner, an organisation Jan Manch represented by lawyer Firdaus Mirza, has sought that the investigation should be taken away from ACB and transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Jan Manch’s original petition in the Vidarbha irrigation scam was filed in 2010 and was disposed off in December 2014 after Fadnavis announced an open inquiry against Pawar.

While Swapnika died while undergoing treatment, Pranitha survived with serious burns.\nAs the issue triggered a nationwide uproar then, Sajjannar, who was the Superintendent of Police of Warangal district, got all the three accused in an alleged police encounter.\nLike in the case of Shadnagar encounter, the three youth were taken to the outskirts on the pretext of reconstruction of the crime and shot dead, when they allegedly attempted to snatch the weapons and fire at the police.\nSajjannar had won a lot of appreciation from all quarters then too, and the college girls had felicitated him.\nNow, by repeating the similar encounter with the four accused in the veterinary doctor murder case, he is once again being hailed as a hero in the social media and in public statements.\n“Hats off to Sajjannar. Had he been the police officer in Vijayawada 10 years ago, justice would have been done to my daughter,” said Shamshad Begum, mother of a 19-year-old pharmacy girl who was raped and murdered at her hostel in Vijayawada in December 2007.\nCelebrities belonging to Telugu film industry also showered their praises on the Telangana police through social media.\n“This morning, I wake up the news and justice has been served #encounter,” tweeted popular actor Akkineni Nagarjuna.\nLakshmi Manchu, another popular actress and daughter of ex-MP M Mohan Babu tweeted: “I do not feel bad.

It will be taken up for passage the next day, government sources said on Thursday.\nAfter clearing the Lok Sabha, the bill will go to the Rajya Sabha or Upper House of Parliament. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has an absolute majority in the Lower House. The Opposition, which is stronger in the Rajya Sabha, hopes to stall the bill in the Upper house.\nThe Congress-led opposition has started reaching out to possible supporters to resist the proposed legislation but is wary that many fence-sitters may ultimately side with the government.\nAs of now, the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Left parties, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are committed to opposing the bill.\nAnd on Thursday, the Bahujan Samaj Party’s (BSP) chief Mayawati spoke against the bill clarifying her party’s stand on the issue.\nMayawati has said that her party is against the bill in its current form and suggested the Centre to send it to the parliamentary committee. She said that the Centre has brought CAB in a hurry and it is “unconstitutional and divisive”. \nMayawati asserted that if the central government takes decisions in favour of the welfare of people, the BSP will support it just the way the party supported abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.\nBut many fence-sitters and even parties otherwise critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government haven’t firmed up their stance, leaving the Congress guessing about what position they would ultimately take. \nA senior Congress strategist said the party would try and get the bill sent to a select committee for scrutiny even as government managers have indicated during informal interactions that they want the CAB to be passed in the ongoing session.\nTrinamool Congress’s (TMC) Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien refused to spell out the party’s stand on the bill. “…from what we know, the BJP is bringing the bill for cheap, narrow gains. We will spell out our stand on the floor of the House,” he said.\nThe TMC has 13 members in the current 238-member Upper house.\nThe Biju Janata Dal, which has seven MPs in the Upper House, is also undecided. \n“Only after the bill comes to the House will our leader Naveen Patnaik take a call,” said Amar Patnaik, senior party leader in the Rajya Sabha.\nThe senior Congress strategist added that Samajwadi Party has indicated it would oppose the bill and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) signalled its intent to join the Opposition. “The response of the TRS is the best news for us,” he said.\nMeanwhile, a BJP leader, who is also a member of the Rajya Sabha where the BJP and its allies have 116 seats, said the party is confident of getting the support of 122 MPs and is expecting more. The current strength of the House is 238.\nThe Congress has so far maintained that it is opposed to CAB on the basis of religion. But the party on Wednesday said it will formulate its stand on the bill after going through the draft.\n“We will have to see in what form, manner the bill is brought, then we will decide on our stand...,” Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.\nThe BJP had exploited fissures within the opposition ranks and managed to clear two landmark bills and the resolution to scrap Article 370 in the last session. \nThe triple talaq bill and the one to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir state was cleared as the opposition bench was divided.', ' Bill Bangladesh Pakistan Bill Hindus Sikhs Jains Parsis Christians Citizenship Amendment Bill Citizenship Act Cabinet Lok Sabha Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha Upper Lower House Rajya Sabha Upper Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Telugu Desam Party Delhi Aam Aadmi Party Bahujan Samaj Party Mayawati Mayawati Centre Centre Mayawati Jammu Kashmir Trinamool Rajya Sabha Derek O Brien Naveen Patnaik Amar Patnaik Rajya Sabha Samajwadi Party Telangana Rashtra Samithi Rajya Sabha Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Jammu Kashmir', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-get-copy-of-citizenship-bill-ahead-of-introduction-in-lok-sabha/story-4A1uDjiFjfJAwm0TIfSQDL.html'),
(98, 'Northeast CMs soften stand on Citizenship Amendment Bill', '\nMost of the chief ministers of the Northeast have softened their stands on the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), set to be introduced in Parliament soon. This is a departure from their earlier stands, when they unequivocally opposed the legislation granting Indian citizenship to undocumented individuals from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. \nHome minister Amit Shah has called for wider consultations on the Bill with several stakeholders in Delhi ahead of the Bill’s introduction in Parliament. Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sharma said as part of the tweaks, the Bill will not be applicable to areas under the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system and areas protected under the Sixth Schedule.\nThe Inner Line Permit is a mandatory document for Indians travelling to the states of Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. A bill to apply the ILP in Manipur -- the Manipur People’s Bill 2018 -- is awaiting a nod from the President after it was passed in the state assembly  \nThe Bill will be circulated among MPs on Friday and will be introduced next week. Despite resistance from Opposition parties, the BJP is also confident of its passage. \nMeghalaya CM Conrad Sangma said the Centre’s approach was positive as it initiated a wider debate by inviting several groups for consultations, while Mizoram CM Zoramthanga said since the state was outside the purview of the Bill as an ILP state, he welcomed it. \nArunachal CM Pema Khandu said he welcomed the Bill after the Centre made changes to the legislation keeping in mind the provisions of the Chin Hills Regulation 1896 and the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873. \nSangma said the Centre’s consultations with over 100 organisations, 23 of which were from Meghalaya, indicated that they were willing to listen. “Each group was given an hour to discuss concerns; many voiced concerns that it will affect indigenous people. The Centre suggested measures and mechanisms to counter it,” Sangma told HT. He added that he will be in a better position to state his stand after seeing a copy of the Bill. \nManipur CM N Biren Singh said while the state does not come under the ILP, he is confident that the Manipur People Bill will be passed. “The home minister has discussed with us the details of a protection mechanism in line with the ILP for Manipur. The ILP regime will automatically keep Manipur out of CAB,” Singh told HT. “However, the exact safeguard will be revealed within a few days.”\n”Our demand has been for Mizoram’s exclusion from the purview of the Bill. If our state is not included under the new legislation, it is well and good. We have no reservations on the newer version of CAB as long as Mizoram is kept outside its purview,” Mizoram CM Zoramthanga said . \nArunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu, who was one of the BJP CMs in the region along with Manipur CM N Biren Singh to have landed in Delhi earlier this year to express his opposition, said he was assured that the demands of his state would be met. \nDuring the conversations, the group from Arunachal expressed its demand that the provisions of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, which regulates the provisions of the ILP, and of the Chin Hills Regulation, 1896, which empowers the Deputy Commissioner to direct a foreigner to leave the state, will have to be honoured. \n“The home minister assured to all of us that the ILP regime will be honoured, and the provisions of both the regulations will be incorporated in the Bill. He told us that there will be zero impact to the indigenous people of Arunachal Pradesh. We welcome the Bill as our concerns were honoured,” Khandu said.

Tamil Nadu politicians do not understand the problems of Sri Lankans. They should allow our government to get on with governance. I support President Rajapaksa because he is the right person to lead our country. Over the years before he came to power, there was no progress. The economy was down, nothing was moving.

(110, '10 million people likely to benefit from bill: Sarma', '\nHow many people are likely to benefit from the contentious Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, once Parliament passes it?\nExact numbers are hard to come by, but, Himanta Biswa Sarma, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party minister in Assam said that around 10 million or 1 crore people would benefit from the change in the law.\nThat number is likely to include some of the 1.9 million residents of the state who do not find their names in Assam’s National Register of Citizens.\nInterestingly, many people who are the targeted beneficiaries of the scheme — non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring countries forced to take refuge in India — have thus far not pushed for citizenship on this count, although some may have already obtained citizenship through other routes according to the Intelligence Bureau.\nIn October 2016, the Director of Intelligence Bureau (IB) told a Joint Parliamentary Committee that , “there are 31,313 persons belonging to minority communities who have been given long term visa on the basis of their claim of religious persecution in their respective countries and want Indian Citizenship”. He was testifying before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, which was tabled in January. He also told the Joint Parliamentary Committee that of the 31,313 people on Long Term Visa’s 25447 were Hindus, 5807 were Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.\nBut the real number could be much higher, he added.\nMany more would have already “taken citizenship by various means.” The DIB added that “they might have obtained passport, ration card. All other documents they might have obtained and they might have already registered themselves in the voter’s list. So, for all practical purposes, they are already citizens of this country.

(111, 'RBI holds rate,slashes growth forecast to 5%', '\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defied expectations by keeping its policy rate  unchanged at 5.15% even as it downgraded its growth projection for the year to 5% — an indication, experts said, that the central bank either understands the limited role of monetary interventions in reviving growth or wants to wait till banks pass on the earlier cuts or both. They added that RBI may have also turned cautious because of a recent spike in inflation. \nThe move surprised many, with the consensus opinion ahead of the policy being that RBI would continue to ease interest rates to revive growth. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the three months ended September came in at 4.5%, the lowest since March 2013.\nStill, RBI, which has thus far cut rates by 1.35 percentage points since February 2019, hinted that it did have room to cut rates in the future if required. \nRBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) cut policy rates for five consecutive meetings till Thursday’s. The pause also means that the central bank is looking to the government to announce measures to  pump-prime the Indian economy, which is expected to grow at a much slower rate than earlier expectations.\n \n MPC has brought down its projected GDP growth rate for the Indian economy in the current fiscal year to 5%, 1.1 percentage points less than what it projected in its October meeting. On a cumulative basis, MPC has reduced the projected growth rate in the current fiscal year by 2.4 percentage points, from 7.4% in February to 5% in December. \nThe government has taken 32 measures to revive the economy, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament last week. This includes a corporate tax rate cut, easier access to credit for non-banking financial companies, a real estate fund, and a more transparent and efficient income tax regime. The MPC is clearly hoping the government will do more. “Similarly, the forthcoming Union budget will provide better insight into further measures to be undertaken by the government and their impact on growth,” RBI’s policy statement said.\nLast week, after the GDP numbers were announced, Atanu Chakraborty, secretary of the department of economic affairs, said that the economy had bottomed out, suggesting that the rest of the year will be better.  \nThe recent spike in inflation might have played a role in the MPC deciding against a sixth consecutive rate cut. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), India’s benchmark inflation measure, grew 4.6% on an annual basis in October 2019, the highest since 4.9% in June 2018. While the MPC has expressed confidence that inflation is likely to moderate below target by the second quarter of next fiscal year, it said that it is “prudent to carefully monitor incoming data to gain clarity on the inflation outlook”. \nThe MPC’s actions become clearer when seen in the context of the results of the latest bimonthly Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS), which is conducted in 13 major cities in the country. Consumer sentiment has worsened on most crucial indicators such as the  general economic situation, income, employment, non-essential spending, etc, between the previous and latest survey, which was conducted in November. \nConsumer sentiment is the lowest on employment and non-essential spending. “Various high frequency indicators suggest that domestic and external demand conditions have remained weak,” the resolution said. However, the MPC has expressed hope that “several measures already initiated by the Government and the monetary easing undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 are gradually expected to feed in the economy” and called for an emphasis on addressing “impediments which are holding back investments”.\nTo be sure, some experts believe the government needs to embark on a major demand push, perhaps through a rural spending programme or income tax cuts, to simply put more money in the hands of people. Finance minister Sitharaman said this week that the government is evaluating income tax cuts. \n“With the growth projection for the current year being revised down from 6.1% to 5%, both government and the central bank should initiate some stronger measures to break the logjam particularly in the stressed sectors of the economy. There has been some active consultation between industry and government, and we expect that between now and the next Union budget some of the additional measures suggested by the industry will be implemented,” Sandip Somany, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said.\nThe next budget will be presented on February 1, 2020. \n“The pause in the rate cycle comes as a surprise given the dismal growth for the second quarter of 2019-20 and the likely persistence of a slowdown. Clearly the RBI has responded to hardening headline inflation and rising inflation expectations of households. It also seems that the RBI wishes to see the lagged impact of its front-loaded 135 basis point cut in the policy rate along and how some of the slew of fiscal measures will play out for future growth,” Abheek Barua, chief economist of HDFC Bank, said.', ' Gross Domestic Product Nirmala Sitharaman Union Atanu Chakraborty Sitharaman Sandip Somany Federation Indian Chambers Commerce Industry Barua', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-holds-rate-slashes-growth-forecast-to-5/story-GHR2759thsT0LVB5nPbe6M.html'),

His bail conditions stipulated that he not speak about the case. \nEarlier in the day, Chidambaram joined other Congress members in their protest against the steep hike in onion prices.\nLater,  at the press conference, Chidambaram alleged that Modi has been “unusually silent” on the economy. “He has left it to his ministers to indulge in bluff and bluster. The net result, as The Economist put it, is that the government has turned out to be an ‘incompetent manager’ of the economy,” he said, referring to an article in the October issue of the magazine.\nHowever, the former finance minister refused to speak on the case pending against him though he made a brief reference to it in his opening statement.\n“I am grateful for the clear and comprehensive order yesterday of the Supreme Court. The order will clear the many layers of dust that have unfortunately settled on our understanding of criminal law and the manner in which criminal law has been administered by our courts,” he said. \n“In the last 106 days, I was strong in spirit and I have become stronger because my record as minister and my conscience are absolutely clear. Officers who have worked with me, business persons who have interacted with me and journalists who have observed me know that very well. My family trusts in God. We have total confidence that the courts will, ultimately, render justice.”\nAsked about the repeated claims made by his lawyers that he had lost 5 kg of weight in prison, Chidambaram replied: “I was always strong in spirit, I am now stronger I think. But I have also become stronger in body. Let me give you a hint. Sleeping on a wooden board without a pillow strengthens your neck, spine and back. My spine is stronger, my neck is stronger and my head is stronger.”\n“I am a better man,” was his reply to another question about his stay in jail.\nChidambaram said the prescription for improving the economy will be useless if the diagnosis is wrong. “Even  seven months into the fiscal year, the BJP government believes the problems faced by the economy are cyclical. The government is wrong. It is wrong because it is clueless,” he said.\nThe Congress leader claimed that the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) dispensation  lifted 140 million  people out of poverty between 2004 and 2014, while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has pushed millions of people below the poverty line since 2016.\n“I believe the Congress and some other parties are better equipped to pull the economy out of the slowdown and push economic growth, but we have to wait for better times,” he said.\nAsked about industrialist Rahul Bajaj’s claim that there is an atmosphere of fear in the country, Chidambaram said: ”There is complete fear everywhere. Every institution is gripped by fear and the media is no exception... Please shed fear, please speak truth to power,” he said.\nChidambaram began his press conference with a reference to Jammu and Kashmir. He said his first thoughts upon his release were with the Kashmiri people who “have been denied their basic freedoms” since August, when the Centre moved to divest the region of its special status under Article 370.  \nIn his reaction to Chidambaram’s comments, Union minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters that the Congress leader had violated the bail condition on the very first day after his release.\n“He has got to speak to the media after so many days and that is why he was taking out his anger on every subject. Some Congress leaders are in jail, some have just got out of jail,  and some are on bail. The opposition party has become desperate. It is not that they were in jail for their role in freedom movement but due to criminal charges against them,” Javadekar said. \nInvoking the Emergency imposed by the Congress government in 1975, he said the then Indira Gandhi government  clamped down on the media while the Modi government had shared all information related to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with Parliament. “The government has allowed journalists from India and abroad to travel to Kashmir. The incidents of stone-pelting have come down by more than half. Kashmir is now on path to progress,” Javadekar said.\nReferring to Chidambaram’s attack on the government on the economic slowdown, he said low inflation and high growth in the economy had been the highlights of the Modi dispensation since 2014 while the opposite was true when the  UPA was in charge.', ' P Chidambaram Narendra Modi Tihar Delhi Modi Asked Rahul Bajaj Chidambaram Jammu Kashmir Centre Prakash Javadekar Javadekar Emergency Indira Gandhi Jammu Kashmir Parliament Kashmir Javadekar Modi', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-chidambaram-slams-handling-of-economy-bjp-hits-back-at-upa/story-8C5Gx9TgJGDPoXaHUSQvJP.html'),

She was one of the only two women to pray inside the temple’s inner sanctum under police protection after the court’s order; about a dozen other women have attempted to do so unsuccessfully.\nKerala police have prevented girls and women  aged between 10 and 50 from visiting the shrine since the two-month annual pilgrimage to the shrine began on November 16, two days after the Supreme Court referred a bunch of pleas seeking a review of the 2018 order to a larger seven-judge bench. \nIn a majority 3-2 verdict on, the court on November 14 did not suspend its earlier order. Justice Rohinton Nariman, who authored the minority dissenting judgment, asked the Kerala government to ensure strict compliance with the 2018 verdict.\nThe 2018 judgment upheld the right to equality of worship, and triggered protests in Kerala. The entry of female worshippers aged between 10 and 50 years into the Sabarimala shrine had banned for decades on grounds that  Lord Ayyappa, the presiding deity, is celibate.\nSenior counsel Indira Jaising, who appeared for Ammini, mentioned the plea for early listing since the temple will be closed. She said that Ammini has been attacked with chemical substances.\nAmmini was attacked on November 27 outside the Kochi police commissioner’s office, where she had gone to seek security for visiting the temple.\nThe CJI remarked that the 2018 judgment is not the last word on the issue and a much larger bench will hear the case after Jaising pointed out that the last year’s verdict has not been stayed.

It looks to fulfil a key election promise of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has set the stage for a parliamentary showdown.\nAccording to officials in the Lok Sabha, the bill has gone for printing and might be circulated among parliamentarians on Friday morning.\nThe opposition parties went into a huddle on Thursday morning to decide a common strategy. Their campaign will focus on certain key issues. The meeting, held at Rajya Sabha leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad’s chamber in Parliament, was attended by parties such as the Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party and Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party. The Shiv Sena, who snapped ties with the BJP last month, was not present, according to two Opposition leaders.\nTrinamool leader Derek O’Brien said the first point which would be highlighted by the Opposition is that the proposed bill “insults” Babasaheb Ambedkar and the founding fathers of the nation. The Opposition will point out that the bill goes against the basic principles of the Indian Constitution, which has never put any religious criteria for obtaining Indian citizenship.\nThe bill proposes to make people from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian and Parsi faiths who entered India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible for citizenship.\nFor the next five days, or till the bill doesn’t come to the House for passage, opposition parties and its MPs would focus on these issues to create public opinion. \nThe second talking point, discussed in the meeting, is that the bill will set different criteria for citizenship. The bill is unlikely to cover areas under the Sixth Schedule, and the three states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram where a visitor requires the Inner Line Permit. Opposition leaders, according to a Congress strategist, will question why the new citizenship law will leave out certain places, creating two separate criteria for becoming an Indian citizen.\nThe government has indicated that it doesn’t want to include these places as several indigenous communities have voiced their concerns that outsiders might settle in their areas and thereby disturb the existing social structure.\nThe Congress and other parties will try to project CAB as an anti-tribal bill as it would affect many tribal communities in the northeast. The parties also plan to turn the tables on the BJP by using Assam’s National Register of Citizen (NRC), which has left out 1.9 million people, in its campaign against CAB. O’Brien said, “The NRC and CAB are a package. They can’t be de-hyphenated. NRC didn’t work out in one state and now the government wants to do expand it to 27 states.” \nSenior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “There is not one but multiple issues related to this bill. Ignoring for the time being that the government is trying make it the first law of the land based on religious classification, I must say that they are bringing this bill to divert attention from precious issues of economy...

On Tuesday, justice Mishra, heading a five-judge Constitution bench hearing land acquisition cases, threatened contempt of court action against Sankaranarayanan. \nThe judge had a disagreement with Sankaranarayanan who, he said, was repeating some arguments already made by other lawyers appearing in the matter. According to people aware of the development, when Sankaranarayanan insisted on completing some submissions before getting to his main argument, justice Mishra said his act could amount to contempt of court. Sankaranarayanan exited the court following the judge’s remark.\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association, which groups lawyers eligible to file cases in the Supreme Court, passed a resolution expressing their concern over the incident and urged the judge to “be a little bit more patient in dealing with lawyers”.\nSenior advocates gathered in court room 3 of the Supreme Court on Thursday much before 10.30 am, the time when the court usually assembles for hearings\nAs soon as the bench comprising justices Arun Mishra and MR Shah assembled, senior counsel Sibal told the court that the lawyers wished to convey to the court “something about courtesy and patience.”\nSibal said that many senior advocates, some of whom have been practising in the Supreme Court for over 40 years, know the traditions of the bar well while judges who come to the apex court stay only for 5 to 7 years before they retire. The key to an affable relationship is that dialogue between the bench and bar should be courteous, Sibal said. \nSenior advocate Dave urged the judge to overlook the mistakes of young lawyers, stating that judges should encourage them and help build the bar. Senior counsel Rohatgi told the court that there was an impression that the atmosphere in justice Mishra’s court was not conducive for junior lawyers.\n“Many of them are fearful. Whether the fear is right or wrong we don’t know but cordiality should remain”, said Rohatgi.\nResponding to the senior advocates, justice Mishra said he harboured no personal ill will against any lawyer and various factors including enormous pressure on the judges caused by the workload might sometimes lead to such remarks by him. He clarified that he never intended to act on his remarks on contempt proceedings against l Sankaranarayanan . “I have not drawn any contempt against any lawyer.

The riots followed the assassination of the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. Rajiv Gandhi, her son, succeeded her as the prime minister that very night.\n“...when the sad event of 1984 took place, Gujral ji on that very sad evening went to the then home minister Shri [PV] Narasimha Rao and told him the situation is so grave that it is necessary for the government to call the army [in] at the earliest. If that advice had been heeded, perhaps the massacre that took place in 1984 could have been avoided,” Singh, a former PM and a senior Congress leader, said on Wednesday at a function to mark the 100th birth anniversary of Gujral, one of his predecessors.\nThe BJP criticised Singh’s remark . Union minister Prakash Javadekar blamed Rajiv Gandhi for the riots, saying the prime minister has the right to order army deployment in such a situation. “In a way, Rajiv Gandhi supported the massacre with his subsequent comments that the earth shakes when a big tree falls,” Javadekar told reporters about the riots following the assassination of Gandhi.\nJavadekar also questioned why, in 1991, Singh went on to become a finance minister in a Cabinet headed by Rao if he had such adverse feelings about the leader. \nNV Subash, a BJP leader and the grandson of Rao, too, condemned Singh’s statement. “As a family member, I am feeling saddened by this statement by Dr. Manmohan Singh; it is unacceptable,” he told news agency, ANI.\nBut Gujral’s son, Naresh Gujral, a parliamentarian from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) — a political ally of the BJP, complimented Singh for being “truthful”.  “I admire and compliment Manmohan Singh for being truthful and calling a spade a spade,” he told news agency, PTI.\nSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said Singh’s statement was a “shocking attempt to shift blame from Rajiv Gandhi and the Nehru-Gandhi family” to Rao.“The claim is shocking because it comes from Manmohan Singh whom we have always genuinely respected. It is inappropriate and indecorous as it involves two former PMs, Narasimha Rao and IK Gujral, neither of whom is alive to respond to this claim,” he said in a statement. “It is intriguing why Manmohan kept quiet when Rao and Gujral were around to confirm or deny this claim,” he said.\nUnion minister and SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said in Madhya PRadesh, “The 1984 massacre of Sikhs is a blot in the history of mother India and for this Rajiv Gandhi was responsible. He held back the Army. And for this, the Gandhi family should apologise.”\nCongress leader, KTS Tulsi, told news agency ANI, “I think the truth is that the entire katleaam [bloodshed] would have been avoided if the army had been deployed, and IK Gujral had advised the then Prime Minister into calling the army but that was not done.”', ' Manmohan Singh Kumar Gujral Rajiv Gandhi Indira Gandhi Rajiv Shri Rao Singh Singh Prakash Javadekar Rajiv Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi Javadekar Gandhi Javadekar Singh Cabinet Rao Rao Singh Singh Gujral Naresh Gujral Shiromani Akali Dal Singh Manmohan Singh Sukhbir Singh Badal Singh Rajiv Gandhi Manmohan Singh Narasimha Rao IK Gujral Manmohan Harsimrat Kaur Badal Madhya PRadesh Sikhs Gandhi', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manmohan-s-remark-on-1984-riots-sparks-debate/story-ouc8oGo0Kz8ftSBBjitQrO.html'),

The committees have members from both houses.  They also showed that just five out of 31 members attended one of the meetings of the home affairs panel, underlining a sudden dip in the attendance of MPs in these eight panels. \nUpset at the low attendance of MPs in panel meetings, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday called the heads of the eight panels that fall under his jurisdiction to brainstorm on how to solve the attendance problem. In an unprecedented  step he also mentioned the names of MPs who attend meetings regularly in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. “I thought that it would be appropriate to mention the names of the Members of this House who attended all the meetings of the Department Related Committees in the august house as a token of appreciation and also to motivate others to do so,” Naidu said.\nHe also expressed unhappiness at the fact that at least 100 MPs have skipped two or more successive meetings of their panels, said a Rajya Sabha  official who asked not to be named.\nIndian Parliament has 24 department-related standing committees to review the functioning of central ministries;  16 of these are under the purview of the Lok Sabha while the remaining eight come under the Rajya Sabha. In all panels, parliamentarians from both Houses are included as members. The attendance records of the 16 committees under the Lok Sabha were not immediately available. \nAfter the panels were reconstituted in September, the Rajya Sabha committees have so far held 41 meetings. Naidu told the chairpersons that the average attendance stands at 49%. The panel on HRD has the highest attendance rate, 65% whereas the home affairs committee’s attendance stands at 39%. “Members’ attendance has been below 50% in 23 of 41 meetings,” Naidu  informed the chairpersons. \nEach of these panels has 10 members from the Rajya Sabha and 21 from the Lok Sabha.\nThe issue of attendance of  members in house committees came into focus last month after just five of 27 members of the urban development panel attended a meeting on pollution. The meeting was cancelled due to lack of quorum, leading to widespread criticism, especially as the national capital region was suffering from severe air pollution at the time. \nRajya Sabha officials added that out of the 28 MPs who haven’t attended any Rajya Sabha standing committee meeting, 17 belong to the  Lok Sabha and the rest are members of the Upper House.\nIn his meeting with the chairpersons, Naidu suggested that the schedule can be prepared much in advance so that MPs can plan accordingly. He also asked the chairpersons to target at least two-thirds attendance in each meeting and the duration of meetings should be “sufficiently long” during inter-session period. The panel heads will keep a record of reasons for absence of MPs from meetings, he said.\n“Naidu informed the chairpersons that he will share the details of attendance of Rajya Sabha panels with the Speaker of Lok Sabha for the benefit of similar assessment of committees in the Lower House,” the first official said.

And anti-venom was found to be ineffective for the two populations of monocled cobra investigated in this study.\nAbout 60 of the 270 snake species found in India  are medically important. This includes various types  of cobras, kraits, saw-scaled vipers, sea snakes, and  pit vipers for which there are no commercially available anti-venom. Usually, when a person is bitten by one of these, a big-four antivenom is used for treatment. \nThe authors of the study,  from the Indian Institute of Science, the Gerry Martin project and the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust found that one population of monocled cobra from West Bengal secretes a venom which is three-times more neurotoxic (toxic to nerve tissue) than the venom of the common cobra, and  that the venom of another population from Arunachal Pradesh is extremely cytotoxic (toxic to cells)  with more than five times the cytotoxins found in the venom of the common cobra.\nThey also found that the Sind Krait in western India secretes venom that is 40 times more potent than that of  the common cobra. The Sind Krait can be easily classified as one of the most “toxic snakes” in India but there is no effective anti-venom to treat its bite, the study added. \nEvolutionary geneticists characterised the venom compositions, biochemical and pharmacological features and toxicity profiles of some major neglected species and their closest big four relatives to arrive at these results. Herpetologists including  Romulus Whitaker and Gerard Martin helped collect venom for the experiments.\n“The big four snakes are largely distributed across the country but there are many regions where other species dominate. For example, in many states in the Northeast, the big four species are not found. Therefore, given the disturbing deficiency in the big four anti-venoms in treating bites from these,  producing region-specific anti-venoms in India is the need of the hour,” said Kartik Sunagar, lead author of the study.\n“Yes, there is intra-species variation where venom from the same species, say Russel’s Viper in south India is immunologically different from Russel’s Viper in north India. This is because the venom for developing anti-venom is sourced from a small part of Tamil Nadu. Sri Lanka which uses anti-venom from India has poorer outcomes for their cobra bites. Also, in the northeast and Bangladesh the monocled cobra is more common for which anti-venom may be ineffective. In Kerala,  for a long time people misunderstood hump nosed pit viper bites to be saw-scaled viper bites. They needed higher doses of anti-venom to treat,” said Ravikar Ralph, researcher at Christian Medical College and Hospital in Vellore.\nAbout 46,000 people die and 140,000 people are disabled every year in the country because of snakebites.\nThe only scientifically validated treatment for snakebites is the use of antivenom, for which manufacturing protocols have remained unchanged for over a century, the study said.

Contrary to speculation that he killed himself, Rahman may have been shot to death by  Surjit Sarkar, from West Bengal’s Burdwan, who too died in the incident. Sarkar may have shot Rahman to save the others, the officer said. \nThe incident took place in Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, where Maoist rebels known as Naxalites are active, on Wednesday. Five ITBP men, including Sarkar, died in the shooting along with Rahman and two were injured.\nHindustan Times quoted Narayanpur’s superintendent of police Mohit Garg as saying that Rahman was gunned down by one of the jawans in self-defence. In New Delhi, an ITBP spokesperson had said Rahman killed the others and turned the gun on himself.   \nInspector general of police, Bastar, Sundarraj P said ITBP officials visited the spot on Thursday and as per the perlimnary investigation, it appears that Rehman was gunned down by one of the injured constables who later succumb in hospital.  “However, the autopsy report is yet to come that will reveal the exact details,” he added. \nThe second ITBP officer cited above said that Rahman, who joined the force in 2009, used to go on leave once a year and had never complained about not getting leave, contradicting a claim by the trooper’s father, Marfat Ali Sheikh of Bengal’s Nadia district, that his son hadn’t been able to come home because he wasn’t getting leave.\n“He was a disciplined soldier against whom not a single complaint was received by his company commander. He too never showed any signs of work stress or lodged a complaint with his seniors raising any issue,” the officer added.\nThe incident happened against the backdrop of ITBP engaging an arm of the Defence Research and Development Organisation  to study long-term problems, including stress, faced by its men when they are posted in the  Himalayas and other operational areas.\nSeveral parliamentary committees have repeatedly flagged the fact that troopers in central paramilitary forces, particularly the Central Reserve Police Force, ITBP and the Border Security Force, didn’t  get sufficient holidays and had to work beyond 12 hours every day. \nTo be sure,  the paramilitary forces have issued guidelines to their  battalion/company commanders to make sure everyone gets leaves on time and that the reasons should be identified and personnel should be  encouraged to go on leave if they aren’t availing of their time off.\nAccording to a home ministry data, about 700 personnel of paramilitary forces have committed suicide between 2012 and 2017 for various reasons including “lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife”.

These consequences are distinct from the consequences flowing from voluntary retirement and the two may not be substituted for each other based on the length of an employee’s tenure”, the court held.\nThe CCS Pension Rules apply to government servants including civilian government servants in the Defence Services appointed before December 31, 2003.\nAs per the rules, an employee forfeits his past service upon resignation, consequently disentitling him to pension. However, an employee who has completed 20 years of service can voluntarily retire from service, which will enable him to avail of pensionary benefits.\nIn this case, the employee, Ghanshyam Chand Sharma, had resigned from service on July 7, 1990. He was subsequently denied pension on the grounds that he had forfeited his past service by resigning. Additionally, the company also argued that Sharma had not completed 20 years of service which would have entitled him to take voluntary retirement. \nThe Delhi high court had ruled in favour of the employee on the grounds that he had completed 20 years of service and his resignation should, therefore, be treated as voluntary retirement. The high court ordered the payment of pensionary benefits to Sharma, following which the BSES went in appeal to the Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court noted that Sharma had resigned from service after his application for voluntary retirement was rejected on the grounds that he had not completed 20 years of service.', ' Rules Ghanshyam Chand Sharma Sharma Sharma Sharma', '2019-12-06', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-pension-for-govt-staff-who-resign-sc/story-2FSj2PS6n4xCTFblKCWwdP.html'),

(128, 'Testimonies, victim’s phone call: How cops traced Hyderabad rape accused', '\nTestimonies from a petrol pump attendant and a tyre mechanic provided crucial leads and helped solve the rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, two officers connected with the investigation said on Sunday.\nThe charred remains of the doctor were found on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Thursday morning, sparking nationwide protests. The first breakthrough came on Friday morning, when the worker at a local petrol pump called the police. He said around 12.30 am on Thursday, two men on a red-coloured scooty approached him for petrol.\nThe make of the two-wheeler given by the attendant matched the one owned by the victim, said the first officer quoted above.\nAlso Watch l Hyderabad rape l Girl should’ve called cops & not sister: Telangana Minister \nThe time given by him was also close to the time of the doctor’s call to her sister on Wednesday, when she said she had a flat tyre at the Tondupally toll plaza and was scared because of a lorry in the vicinity.\nThe police took down the description of the two men, as stated by the attendant.\nHe provided a second crucial clue: When refused, the men continued towards Shadnagar. This helped police narrow the scope of their inquiries to one stretch of the highway. Police began canvassing all petrol stations, mechanics and establishments on the highway that had CCTVs.\nAt this point, a tyre mechanic who worked near the toll plaza told police that two men on Wednesday night filled air in a red two-wheeler – the details identical to the victim’s scooty and description by the attendant.\nThe CCTV footage from a nearby establishment showed the presence of a lorry.\nThe victim’s phone call had mentioned a lorry, and the police had already identified a parked lorry less than 300 feet from the toll plaza on Wednesday night. But the investigators couldn’t identify the vehicle’s number because it was dark.\nPolice examined CCTV footage from earlier on Wednesday and found the lorry was parked near the plaza and the number of the vehicle was visible, said the second police officer.\nThat helped the police track down the lorry owner Srinivas Reddy. Reddy told police that Mohammed Areef was the driver and Jollu Srini, Jollu Naveen and Chenna Keshavalu were with him. He also told the authorities that their native place was in Naryanpet district.\nThe four accused confessed to their crime, said police on Friday.\n“What is disturbing is how coolly and meticulously they planned the whole thing. Even after committing the crime they wrapped the body in a blanket and set it on fire. They even went back on the same scooty to check whether the body is properly burnt or not. They disposed of the scooty after removing the number plate. Later, they drove in the same lorry, split up at Aramghar Chowrashta where the accused 2, 3 and 4 left to their native place while the driver Mohammed Areef delivered the lorry load in the city,” said a third top police officer on condition of anonymity.\nCommissioner of Police, Cyberabad, VC Sajjanar, did not respond to calls or text messages for further details on the investigation.

(129, '‘Keep talking to me’: Hyderabad vet’s last phone call to sister', '\nThe scene changes drastically as you drive off the Hyderabad-Bangalore highway at the Chatanpally crossing. The wide road leads to a narrow path, concrete gives way to mud, and bright lights switch to total darkness. On this zigzagged path, an underpass opens out on to the service road on the other side. Inside this underpass is one of the quietest, darkest, and remotest patches of land on the 285-km route connecting two state capitals. It’s so cut off from the buzz of speeding cars above that it’s unlikely anyone would have noticed someone being set on fire inside it  — especially in the middle of the night. \nAnd no one did on the intervening night of November 27 and 28.\nAt 5am on November 28, a milkman from Chatanpally village took the underpass on his way to the other side and saw something burning. He dismissed it as a fire lit by someone to keep warm. On his way back, at 7am, the fire was still on. Curious, he went to inspect it  and saw a human hand sticking out of the fire. He called up the police on his mobile phone. By then, officers at the Shadnagar police station were already looking for a missing person for a few hours.\nAlso Watch l Hyderabad rape shocker: Jaya Bachchan says accused should be lynched \nA 26-year-old veterinary doctor in a southern suburb of Hyderabad left her house at 5.30pm the previous day. The last time her family heard from her was at 9. 22pm when she called her sister  from a toll plaza on the Bangalore-Hyderabad highway, and told her that she was feeling scared. She said her scooter had a puncture and a bunch of men had offered to help, but she was feeling uncomfortable around them. “Keep talking to me,” she told her sister a few minutes before disconnecting the call. When her sister rang her back on her mobile phone at 9. 45pm, she found it switched off. Her sister rushed to file a complaint at the nearest police station at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport police station, but she was told by the officers on duty that the toll plaza didn’t fall in their jurisdiction. The family claims  they were told that she may have just “eloped with a boyfriend” and also asked  whether she had any “lovers or affairs”.\nAt 3.10am, the family finally managed to register a missing-person complaint at Shadnagar police station. These were crucial hours as the police would discover later: between 9.45 and 10.30pm, the woman was gang-raped and murdered a few metres off the Nehru-ORR toll plaza. The crimes were allegedly plotted hours previously. \nAt 6pm, when the 26-year-old drove to the toll plaza from her house, 10km away, to park her scooter and hail a shared taxi farther into the city, a common practice for residents in the suburb, she didn’t notice four young men sitting in a circle and sharing a bottle of whiskey. As the police later pieced together, the four men, Mohammed Arif (26), Jolly Shiva (20), Jollu Naveen (20) and Chenna Keshavalu (21), worked as drivers and cleaners of a lorry that plied between Bangalore and Hyderabad carrying construction material, mainly iron nails and bricks. Somewhere on the route, the police said, they stopped at a scrap shop, sold off a pack of iron nails, and bought four bottles of liquor. They were making their way through the first bottle when they noticed the young woman park her scooter and get into a taxi headed towards Gachibowli, 20km away, where she had an appointment with a dermatologist. \nOne of them punctured her scooter’s tyre shortly after she left. Then they resumed the drinking, and waited for her to return. At 9. 20pm, when she came back and discovered the flat tyre, the leader of the group, Arif, approached her and offered help. Arif walked with her to the toll booth and asked the operator to point them in the direction of a bike repair shop, as the operator, Shonu, told the police. He gave them directions to a repair shop a short distance away, but on the side road leading off the highway. As the vet  dragged the scooter with the group of men off the highway, Arif suggested that one of his men proceed to the repair shop while the others wait with her near toll plaza. The remaining three men persuaded her to walk into a dark compound housing an abandoned worker’s room surrounded by overgrown bushes to the left of the plaza. This is when she panicked and called up her sister, but between the time she hung up and her sister called her back, the fourth man had returned, and one of them had seized her mobile phone and turned it off. Then the group was taking turns to rape her, after forcing her to consume some liquor, according to the police report. “They forcibly committed gang rape against her will and consent, robbed her of her belongings, and murdered her by smothering,” said the remand report of the Shadnagar police. \nBy 11pm, the four men allegedly tossed her dead body into their lorry and planned its disposal. While two of them, with Arif at the wheel, drove the lorry towards Bangalore, the other two followed them on the vet’s scooter. They then decided to burn the body.\n“Shiva and Naveen went to a petrol bunk to purchase petrol but the worker there refused to give petrol,” the report said. It was he who later gave the investigating officers their first breakthrough. On November 29, a worker at an Essar petrol bunk near Nandigama village, called the Shadnagar police after watching the news, and told them that on the midnight of 27/28 November, two men aged around 20 came in on a red Hero Maestro scooter and asked for petrol to be filled in a plastic bottle. “They went to another bunk and purchased petrol to set fire to the body. On the way, near Ashiyana Hotel, they found a bridge and decided to dispose of the body under the bridge,” the report added. “Chenna Keshavulu turned the lorry towards Hyderabad and they took the dead body under the bridge. Arif  poured petrol on the body, Naveen poured diesel, and Shiva lit the fire with a match box. Sim card, handbag of the deceased were thrown in the flames … Arif and Keshavulu left the spot in lorry, Shiva and Naveen followed on the scooty. On the way, near Kothur bus stop, Shiva and Naveen parked the scooty and boarded the lorry.”  They removed the number plate of the scooter before leaving it behind. Then they went to their villages, changed their clothes, and went to bed.  At 7am on November 28, the police station in Shadnagar received information about the burning body.  A  police team arrived shortly with the father of the missing doctor who took one look at the remains and identified his daughter.\nBased on information from the CCTV cameras on the highway and leads from the toll-booth operator, the scooter repair mechanic, the petrol pump workers and the owner of the lorry fleet, the police arrested the four suspects from the neighbouring Narayanpet district hours after the discovery of the dead body. They are currently in a 14-day police remand in Cherlapalli jail just outside Hyderabad.\nAs news travelled, people across India reacted in outrage to the brutal rape and murder of the 26-year-old veterinarian. Many were reminded of the Delhi gang rape in 2012, when a 24-year-old physiotherapy student was raped and murdered in a moving bus by a group of six men, a crime that drove a nationwide movement for women’s rights and a revision of  rape laws.  In common with the 2012 case, this too was tangled up in gender and class battles; while the victim was a middle-class professional from the city, the perpetrators are blue-collar workers from villages. Protests took place widely, from outside the police station and jail, where the suspects were produced to campuses and streets, from Hyderabad’s Charminar  to Delhi’s Jantar Mantar. Near the toll booth where the veterinarian was raped and murdered, 26-year-old protestor Swati Devarakonda, a software developer, said, “ When they said on TV that it was just a few metres away from the toll booth, I couldn’t believe,  given that it is busy round-the-clock. Which is why I came to see for myself. She was the same age as me and must have had similar dreams and ambitions. I carry a pepper spray but if four men attack one girl, how can anybody defend themselves? . We should make an example of culprits.”\n“If our women and children are not safe, what is the use of police and government. Like in Arab countries, publicly behead culprits. This has nothing to do with religion. We should not allow anybody to divide us. If the police, courts can’t handle the culprits, hand them to the public, we will take care,” said Maqdoom Pasha, a fruit seller, who had come to the spot with his wife. \nMany politicians and ministers in Telangana have visited and consoled the victim’s family. In a series of tweets, KT Rama Rao, minister in state cabinet and son of chief minister K Chandrashekara Rao, pleaded with the Prime Minister: “Hon’ble PM @narenramodi ji, 7 years after Nirbhaya’s ghastly rape and murder, the convicts are not hung…”\nOn Sunday, KCR said that fast track court would ensure speedy justice in the case and that the government would extend all assistance required to the victim’s family. “Everybody comes and tell us justice will be done. What is the use? Will our smiling daughter comeback? After Nirbhaya case too, nothing has changed. That is the tragedy of the country,” said the deceased’s uncle at her building complex. \nNearly 150km away, in Narayanpet district, the villages are eerily quiet. All four suspects in the case belong to this district. Three of them, Naveen, Shiva and Keshavulu, are from the Gudigandla village, and the main suspect, Arif, from Jakulaire village. Although the district is close and well connected to the IT hubs of Hyderabad, most people in the villages either work in the farms or pick up odd jobs around the city. The three suspects from Gudigandla are school drop-outs who, when they weren’t picked up from the village by lorry drivers, spent their time loafing or sleeping, according to their families and neighbours. \n“For last six months, he hadn’t worked. He had left for the lorry cleaning job three days ago,” said Lakshmi, mother of Jolly Naveen. Since her husband died in 2006, she works in other people’s farms. She did not have the time to track her son’s habits and movements. “I have my job. I have my daughter,” she said. “When he left he didn’t say where he was going. His work was loading and unloading boxes. He made ~5,000 a month from it. When he came back, he used to be grimy from head to toe. When he came early morning on Thursday, he followed his routine -- had a bath, had food, and slept. Some time later, he got a call from his cousin Chenna Keshavulu and left for his house. He didn’t come back,” she said. \nNaveen was arrested from the house of Chenna Keshavulu, where the police was waiting for him. Lakshmi found out why he had not returned after watching the news on television and from neighbours. She has been angry ever since. “He is my only son, so I naturally love him, but if they did what is being alleged, then they all deserve to be hanged.”\nAt the house of Jollu Shiva, his father, Jollu Rajaih, says he wasn’t even around when his son left or when he came back, because he was away at a distant farm where he lives and works. He has been to the police station since, he says, but he wasn’t allowed to talk to his son. “I wanted to ask him how and why all of this happened. He never drank, he never spoke to any girl in the village, never troubled anyone,” said Rajaih. The father said he will follow his principles, though. “He is young but he is responsible for his actions. I have a daughter. I won’t stand for any of this if its true.”\nAcross the road from Shiva’s house, Keshavulu’s mother, also a farm worker, refuses to believe her son is capable of rape and murder. “No way he would have done anything. Perhaps he tagged along, stood and watched,” she said. For years, she says, his son has suffered from a kidney defect whose treatment, including monthly dialysis, swallows up most of the family’s earnings. “We took very good care of our son, we pampered him. When will they release him? My husband is very angry, he wants to drink himself to death. I don’t have the will to live,” she said.\nA short drive from Gandigudla is Jakulaire, Arif’s village, where his parents, too, are dealing with shock. “When he came back that morning, he didn’t eat, he even refused water. He said while he was driving the lorry one girl drove in the opposite direction on her scooter and he hit her by mistake, and she died. This is all I know,” said his mother, Moole Bi. She received information about his alleged actions since, but she would rather not believe it. “How can my son do this?”', ' Hyderabad Jaya Bachchan Hyderabad Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Mohammed Arif Jollu Naveen Chenna Keshavalu Bangalore Hyderabad Gachibowli Arif Arif Arif Shiva Naveen Essar Hero Maestro Ashiyana Hotel Chenna Keshavulu Hyderabad Arif Naveen Shiva Arif Keshavulu Shiva Naveen Shiva Naveen Shadnagar Delhi Hyderabad Charminar Delhi Jantar Mantar Swati Devarakonda Arab Maqdoom Pasha Telangana K Chandrashekara Rao Hon Nirbhaya Nirbhaya Naveen Shiva Keshavulu Arif Hyderabad Lakshmi Naveen Chenna Keshavulu Chenna Keshavulu Lakshmi Jollu Shiva Jollu Rajaih Rajaih Shiva Keshavulu Gandigudla Jakulaire Arif Moole Bi', '2019-12-03', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-talking-to-me-hyd-s-night-of-horror/story-xhViTommZxCyBrNhizP4UO.html'),
